Tom Brady can do it occasionally, but he also has a really good O-line and a smart head coach. Peyton Manning has had the help of being completely loaded at receiver. Aaron Rodgers, like Russell Wilson, has had the help of a talented running back. Unlike Wilson, however, he's also got several Pro Bowl receivers to throw the ball to. Tony Romo had the help of a great offensive line, a pretty good running back, and a great WR. And the quarterback has nothing to do with how the defense plays.

Still, I think Seattle makes it to the post-season at 12-4, Takes the NFC West, and then has a knife fight with Green Bay. That Game is a toss up. However, we proved that while Green Bay needs all 60 minutes to win a game, the Seahawks can do it in a little over 5.  As long as they don't perform like they did last game, I think that tips the odds slightly in favor of Seattle. \n\nWhen I think GB, I don't think defense. I think offense. Their defense just does damage mitigation for Rogers. They aren't a scoring element like Seattle is. \n\nI think Seattle is built to make another run this year.  However, with cap issues certainly looming for next year via Wilson's contract, they had better enjoy this time while it lasts and play their absolute best.\n\n-----\nDaniel Genrich","created_time":"2015-07-09T18:18:51+0000","id":"10152920085701722_10152920112331722"},{"from":{"name":"Darius Holmes","id":"1026613017351684"},"message":"Hell yeah.
