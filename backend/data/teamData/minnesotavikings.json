The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's an offensive freaking naked beefcake show courtesy by management and media. It's exploitation and objectification of naked young male athletes. Management makes it an obligatory condition in their contracts. Here’s an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man up” by management and media. It’s the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sandusky’s and Graham James’s of this world. That’s the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked. The action takes place on the playing surface, not the locker room. Get the bloody media voyeurs out of the locker room.","created_time":"2015-07-29T19:17:29+0000","id":"10153469229212836_10153469787207836"},{"from":{"name":"VangPao Yang","id":"10106491960391270"},"message":"its good to see both defense and offense winning some battles. i'd be worried if one side was dominating the whole thing.","created_time":"2015-07-29T20:31:50+0000","id":"10153469229212836_10153469904127836"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzU=","before":"NTk="},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/64444137835_10153469229212836/comments?order=chronological&summary=true&access_token=CAAXEZBZArg9yEBADdhnWDPpd9V6UZBNH1lbyUXAs4kZA4jppv8DUlTkNpuPdeSLBg2YZAILgVBRZA3NlPDnOtP0eEUiJL5Q69d934kVcpzKYNCiNlyZCENXzZBQ3yDT7rXTr4UnLRwRmCc4lS1DRl9IZBivpzTvO2yoZAhVRS0GLmFd7wfCQA8EiZCJtJ2iZAKvx1AlGXxmkjZCmqJGqquToGZC1YRHqSkYyp6ZAcEZD&limit=25&after=MzU%3D"},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":59,"can_comment":true}}},{"created_time":"2015-07-29T01:45:09+0000","shares":{"count":111},"link":"https://www.facebook.com/minnesotavikings/photos/a.106413462835.95713.64444137835/10153468552747836/?type=1","id":"64444137835_10153468552747836","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Eddie Duarte","id":"906907802683688"},{"name":"Lyndon Wurtz","id":"1608044649447589"},{"name":"Dylan Shultz","id":"478946932279790"},{"name":"Peterson Iresne","id":"912832335463732"},{"name":"Kathleen Buckley McCombs","id":"10153284389769843"},{"name":"Kim Vanderhoff","id":"978709905495846"},{"name":"Tad Donald","id":"866751730067671"},{"name":"Lobo Aaron Amgulo","id":"697151847084067"},{"name":"Bob Westman","id":"10207552159109099"},{"name":"Michael Peshlakai","id":"815832335203741"},{"name":"Mankato City Center Hotel","id":"136090206457600"},{"name":"Capo Garfias","id":"826471434126890"},{"name":"Clodo Febvre","id":"1106713159343423"},{"name":"Matt Crawford","id":"985614084792442"},{"name":"Vicki Breeden","id":"294234467413727"},{"name":"Kenneth Dressen","id":"1471972363113356"},{"name":"Shakeem Thompson","id":"810847839026222"},{"name":"Kathy Telecky","id":"952535798135797"},{"name":"Will Small","id":"10207201930588706"},{"name":"Aaron TwiZtid Meister Hanson","id":"1459790250989437"},{"name":"Cindy Stenson","id":"1187921454555468"},{"name":"David Garcia","id":"1616172718622086"},{"name":"Daniel Morgan","id":"10100459887383993"},{"name":"Jarka Urbánková","id":"866844336683951"},{"name":"Ron Yurkoski","id":"10206446441654811"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDY0NDY0NDE2NTQ4MTE=","before":"OTA2OTA3ODAyNjgzNjg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/64444137835_10153468552747836/likes?summary=true&fields=name&access_token=CAAXEZBZArg9yEBADdhnWDPpd9V6UZBNH1lbyUXAs4kZA4jppv8DUlTkNpuPdeSLBg2YZAILgVBRZA3NlPDnOtP0eEUiJL5Q69d934kVcpzKYNCiNlyZCENXzZBQ3yDT7rXTr4UnLRwRmCc4lS1DRl9IZBivpzTvO2yoZAhVRS0GLmFd7wfCQA8EiZCJtJ2iZAKvx1AlGXxmkjZCmqJGqquToGZC1YRHqSkYyp6ZAcEZD&limit=25&after=MTAyMDY0NDY0NDE2NTQ4MTE%3D"},"summary":{"total_count":2189,"can_like":true,"has_liked":false}},"comments":{"data":[{"from":{"name":"Randy Hill","id":"10153485421409764"},"message":"I thought you meant he was kicked off the team for wearing a helmet-cam.","created_time":"2015-07-29T02:34:43+0000","id":"10153468552747836_10153468621102836"},{"from":{"name":"Mark Hermanson","id":"10154000472920288"},"message":"Quote me on this...\"Thielen will make multiple key plays throughout the 2015 season to help the Vikings win the Lombardi trophy.\"","created_time":"2015-07-29T04:48:54+0000","id":"10153468552747836_10153468756467836"},{"from":{"name":"Noah Dale","id":"902057563183032"},"message":"My favorite player on the Vikings other than Teddy and A.P.","created_time":"2015-07-29T02:26:02+0000","id":"10153468552747836_10153468608902836"},{"from":{"name":"Dawn Eichhorst","id":"961038830605544"},"message":"One of the hardest working members on the team!!

The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's an offensive freaking naked beefcake show courtesy by management and media. It's exploitation and objectification of naked young male athletes. Management makes it an obligatory condition in their contracts. Here’s an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man up” by management and media. It’s the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sandusky’s and Graham James’s of this world. That’s the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked. The action takes place on the playing surface, not the locker room. Get the bloody media voyeurs out of the locker room.","created_time":"2015-07-26T22:34:03+0000","id":"10153462858687836_10153463546192836"},{"from":{"name":"Bob Stenseth","id":"1012692995442736"},"message":"This is a good team GO VIKES","created_time":"2015-07-26T19:07:02+0000","id":"10153462858687836_10153463172962836"},{"from":{"name":"Tammy Van Vleet","id":"1471532349825407"},"message":"Love Charles - he's an amazing, talented player...wishing you a great season......","created_time":"2015-07-26T19:01:18+0000","id":"10153462858687836_10153463164367836"},{"from":{"name":"James McDougall","id":"10207358242853765"},"message":"Tim Perry how good would the Vikings be on on hard knocks!","created_time":"2015-07-27T06:45:33+0000","id":"10153462858687836_10153464310927836"},{"from":{"name":"Terry Louise Rosati","id":"10203110251797391"},"message":"Interesting do....","created_time":"2015-07-26T20:56:39+0000","id":"10153462858687836_10153463386077836"},{"from":{"name":"Ernie De La Rosa","id":"10153502909407390"},"message":"Does anyone know if there is a live feed for training camp?","created_time":"2015-07-26T17:00:20+0000","id":"10153462858687836_10153462975962836"},{"from":{"name":"Frances Dominguez","id":"873819129373809"},"message":"Welcome to MN Vikings team.

It's 7 against their front 7, a body on a body. As opposed to I formation where 1 defender (atleast 1) is free to flow towards play.\nTE is usually always in motion, in Norv offenses, declaring him an H-back.

Effectively shutting down both the #1 and #2 WR's. \n\nIn a zone defense, it will all depend on who lines up across from rhodes because a zone defense means that the corners must stay in a particular space (their home) until the ball is thrown or handed off to the running back.","created_time":"2015-07-14T00:56:32+0000","id":"10153429608562836_10153429861762836"},{"from":{"name":"Paul Severson","id":"10203420962283019"},"message":"Depends on how much they trust Trae Waynes.

Totally back Bridge...they will make the playoffs,2nd round and if they continue next year on the same path.... I'll see you at the Super Bowl.  Much love and sorry for anybody that's not a Vikes fan.....
