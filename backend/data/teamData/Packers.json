I felt in 2010, especially in the playoffs, he was more aggressive and we really would put our foot on the gas. However; these past few years I thought we had the offense to have those 50+ point games, like we did against Chicago and Philly, every week and yet we didn't push the limits. So I'm excited to see if Clements will add more aggressive play calling to our offense. All that being said, Coach McCarthy has proven himself to be an amazing HC. It feels like this season he will finally add a little spark to his personality that has been lacking. Hopefully without the play calling duties he will me more tuned in to the pulse of the team.

Same with the Seahawks they allowed them to drive down field but forced a turnover before they could score.

Especially appreciated his statement that what he wants most is to be remembered as a good man...  so very bummed I didn't get to see the flag football game, it looked like a bunch of grown boys having theitme of their life.. hope they do more of that kind of thing and WOW, so impressed that they could run as well as they did and OMG Favre's arm is as good as ever.

I have been a fan of his since that day he went in for Majikowski. I remember watching this kid take risks, launch that ball, leading those men without a huddle. It was pure football; he turned watching football around; especially Packer football.\n\nMany of you haters don’t remember Packer football in the 1970’s and 1980’s, OMG it was hard to remain faithful; basically we sucked, we were a joke to the league.  Yes, Favre holds a record for interceptions but those represent risks he took.  He didn’t play safe, textbook ball…he rewrote the textbook on what a quarterback should be and look like; in terms of leadership, respect and ability.  There have been imitators, there have been wannabees but what Brett Favre has is something one is born with because it’s not just athletic ability but something in his character. \n\nNow I don’t care about cell phone picts, or who he played for; the fact is Green Bay would not have a football team had he not went into play when Majikowksi was injured that day.  Lambeau Field would not be the stadium it is had Favre not been part of this organization.  He deserves a huge thank you from the organization, the NFL and the fans.","created_time":"2015-07-19T14:25:12+0000","id":"10153309818240073_10153309925255073"},{"from":{"name":"Kathryn Albrecht- Kielpinski","id":"897917836921331"},"message":"A phenomenal evening for a classic, humble guy & his remarkably classy family, from the best professional sports team in all of the NFL.

Brett is why I started watching football.  It was always fun to watch as Brett loved playing football and you never knew what he might do.  It was great.  I will always remember Brett Favre as the greatest football player ever.  I will always remember those days.  My son and daughter-in-law and grandsons bought me a Brett Favre plaque with his picture and accomplishments on it.  I love it and they couldn't have given me a nicer birthday present.  God Bless Brett Favre and his Family.","created_time":"2015-07-19T13:46:38+0000","id":"10153309334670073_10153309861075073"},{"from":{"name":"Susan Elster","id":"1621217228135191"},"message":"Thank you Brett Favre for making the Packers a legend team.

I am a diehard Packers fan, a diehard Favre fan, and a diehard Rodgers fan. Let me say this, first a big thanks to Ron Wolf giving Favre a chance, but mainly without old #4 the packers would be nowhere today. People forget we were trash for 29 years until Favre won us Super bowl 31. Favre was clearly the face of the NFL from the mid 90s to the time Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl. Today you can't really say there is a \"face\" of the NFL. Rodgers is a dang good quarterback but he needed those years behind Brett. We as packers fans are so spoiled to go from Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers that we forget just how good Brett was for us. Instead of comparing the two appreciate them! There will never be a better QB TO QB switch in NFL history. Only other two were Montana to Young and Peyton Manning to Andrew Luck and those don't even touch this. Brett Favre is the reason I became a football fan and packers fan at 3 years old. Favre is the reason I played High school, college, and semi professional Quarterback. He is why I loved the position and Rodgers is what kept my love for it all when Favre retired. \n\nNow it was hurtful seeing Favre in purple. I cheered for him but not against the Packers. I could never hate on him though not after all those years he gave us. It's because of Favre that the packers are what they are today. That guy put a city on his back like Jordan put Chicago on his. You gotta thank guys like that. \n\nLastly when you think The. GREEN...BAY...PACKERS you think 5 things\n\n1. Vince Lombardi\n2. Lambeau Field \n3. Brett Favre\n4. Aaron Rodgers\n5. Titletown/Super Bowls\n\n(There is so much more) \n\nGo Pack Go everyone!","created_time":"2015-07-18T05:36:32+0000","id":"10153307321570073_10153307348745073"},{"from":{"name":"Dee Edgren","id":"10204529411370329"},"message":"Love you Favre.....forever a Packer!!!","created_time":"2015-07-18T05:07:10+0000","id":"10153307321570073_10153307324540073"},{"from":{"name":"Christopher Hastings","id":"900934396665996"},"message":"The Ol Gunslinger, Back in the Packer family !!!
