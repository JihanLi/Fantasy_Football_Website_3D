Symptoms include an overwhelming desire to place a player on a undeserved pedestal based on making a couple plays.  Here's to hoping that Eifert turns into a top flight TE, but how bout letting him EARN the praise first.  This will be his first yr. being the no. 1 TE, let's hope he can do more than catch wide open passes.  He no longer has the shield of Gresham being the primary focus of the oppositions TE coverage.

Andy needs to work on arm strength. He and AJ have most ints in NFL as QB/WR Combo. Why? Can't get that deep. Defences can load box cause the know Andy not throwing over their head. Sanu just not quick enough. He hasn't had very many back to back decent games. Then comes the obvious mental issue....................he has to step up in big games. (Period!!) This is it for THIS team. If they can't get a playoff win or 3 this year, big changes. I don't see AJ resigning. Andy could be cut with not a huge financial hit.

But as far as I'm concerned, Dalton has no more excuses this year. The Bengals have a top 10 O-line in front of him, the best RB tandem in the NFL behind him, a stable of proven successful WRs, and now some added depth and talent at TE and also again at WR.  If he can't get a playoff win with this offense, he doesn't deserve to be a starting QB in the NFL and the Bengals should look elsewhere in the coming offseason for a signal caller.","created_time":"2015-06-01T17:43:36+0000","id":"10153336561343416_10153336776868416"},{"from":{"name":"Randy E Greene","id":"942358439161042"},"message":"anything Wright adds would be a shock, speed isn't everything","created_time":"2015-06-02T14:52:40+0000","id":"10153336561343416_10153338554253416"},{"from":{"name":"MyKing Nisir Duncan","id":"1138150369534886"},"message":"The Dalton gang needs to include alot of DB's from all over the NFL because they caught more passes from him then his receivers!","created_time":"2015-06-01T15:28:10+0000","id":"10153336561343416_10153336602913416"},{"from":{"name":"Jonathan Jeffries","id":"10206672290501408"},"message":"Marvin Jones and Tyler Eifert returns will help Dalton big time.
