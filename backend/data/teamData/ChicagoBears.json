The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's a freaking naked beefcake show courtesy of management. Here's an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\n\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man upâ by management and media. Itâs the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sanduskyâs and Graham Jamesâs of this world. Thatâs the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women.

The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's a freaking naked beefcake show courtesy of management. Here's an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\n\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man upâ by management and media. Itâs the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sanduskyâs and Graham Jamesâs of this world. Thatâs the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women.

The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's a freaking naked beefcake show courtesy of management. Here's an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\n\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man upâ by management and media. Itâs the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sanduskyâs and Graham Jamesâs of this world. Thatâs the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked. The action takes place on the playing surface, not the locker room. Get the bloody media voyeurs out of the locker room.","created_time":"2015-07-14T22:46:20+0000","id":"10153465850184452_10153468440509452"},{"from":{"name":"Sara Cameron","id":"735972679834534"},"message":"Hey Everyone.

I emailed late in the week and did not expect an answer.  The first response stated that it was too late. I soon received a follow up email that stated if I can get it there before game time they will fly it. Now it's Friday, the game is on Sunday.  I called UPS to get an overnight estimate of cost. It was going to cost me $150.00. I thought that was ridiculous and chose not to send my flag. I emailed the Bears and thanked them for there willingness to fly my flag and that I wasn't going to pay $150 to overnight my flag.         \n\nTwo weeks later I received a flag in the mail with a certificate that it was a flag flown over Section O during the playoff game. \n\nThat's how you make a Bear fan for life.","created_time":"2015-07-03T23:36:01+0000","id":"10153440869164452_10153441543459452"},{"from":{"name":"Michael Galvan","id":"10206145021518743"},"message":"So are the Bears being paid by the military to support them or are the Bears really doing this?

Tom Waddle: Who can beat 12 time pro bowler Tom Waddle? Well, that's a lie, but man that guy could take a beating.\n\n3. Raymont Harris: Also known as the Ultraback. Not sure why, but when he broke his neck, he hung on to the ball...\n\n2. Erik Kramer: Back in the day, Erik Kramer led a bears offense that put up 29 points a game... which was unheard of for the Bears at that time. Too bad the defense gave up 30 points a game...\n\n1.

Plus I'd rather have Cutler throwing the ball to K-White instead of some rookie right now.","created_time":"2015-06-17T23:59:28+0000","id":"10153400532874452_10153401389009452"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njcw","before":"Njk0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/115897014451_10153400532874452/comments?order=chronological&summary=true&access_token=CAAXEZBZArg9yEBADdhnWDPpd9V6UZBNH1lbyUXAs4kZA4jppv8DUlTkNpuPdeSLBg2YZAILgVBRZA3NlPDnOtP0eEUiJL5Q69d934kVcpzKYNCiNlyZCENXzZBQ3yDT7rXTr4UnLRwRmCc4lS1DRl9IZBivpzTvO2yoZAhVRS0GLmFd7wfCQA8EiZCJtJ2iZAKvx1AlGXxmkjZCmqJGqquToGZC1YRHqSkYyp6ZAcEZD&limit=25&after=Njcw"},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":694,"can_comment":true}}},{"name":"Fox on Bennett returning","created_time":"2015-06-16T22:57:47+0000","shares":{"count":107},"link":"http://chgobrs.com/1LeyGqP","id":"115897014451_10153399019234452","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Devon Scott","id":"857935480941710"},{"name":"Jaylen Aldridge","id":"1453194928339862"},{"name":"Karen Klein","id":"528009914033349"},{"name":"John Morris","id":"1479447989031939"},{"name":"Kevin Bonds","id":"10204175299294393"},{"name":"Domonique Emmanuel","id":"467199410125936"},{"name":"Deb McKinney","id":"10207208153383678"},{"name":"Derek M.

I know some of you are saying that Cutler should've been the one traded and not Marshall, but that didn't happen so let that go. I think Cutler will FINALLY do well this season because he won't be throwing the ball 50 times a game that's for sure, Matt Forte will be running the ball 25-30 times a game so that should help Cutler out, and the offensive line will be playing better now that everyone is healthy. Hey Cutler received the Toni Romo treatment last season, look what the Cowboys did when they took away half of Romo's passing plays last season and ran the ball more, that's what the Bears will do with Cutler this season. Cutler knows he has the weapons to win games, now he just has to play smarter, and I truly believe he will this season, because if he doesn't then I will finally give up on him and look towards the future. It's do or die for Cutler, but I still have faith in him.

We are rebuilding, most rebuilding jobs take more than 1 season. We went the wrong direction with Emery and Tressmn, we got away from what we do which is play tough defense, have great special teams, and run the foot ball. Instead we wanted to be the next \"greatest show on turf\" that did not fit our personell with Cutler at the QB. Our schedule is really hard this year, if we make the playoffs it will be one of the greatest turnarounds in the history of the game. But make no mistake there is a good chance that this is another tough season. Last year we had no margin for error on defense, if our team couldnt score almost every time they got the ball we fell further and further behind. And it seemed like the one time the defense decided to play a little, the offense stalled. We were not good in any phase. It will probably take some time to get the ship righted with so little talent on defesne. That doesnt mean we are not good fans, it means we are realistic. You think Jacksonville fans think they are going to make the playoffs coming off the season they had.","created_time":"2015-06-04T13:19:24+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153374234719452"},{"from":{"name":"William Ford","id":"1128772690484618"},"message":"It's funny how cutlers fans love him as much as the packer fans love him,when Mr twitch leaves all you Cutler nut huggers make sure to follow","created_time":"2015-06-03T22:09:35+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153373335064452"},{"from":{"name":"Thomas Cosentino","id":"868345779869606"},"message":"Get a grip Cutler is there this year, sit back and watch like everyone else if he's bad bye bye if he turns around we keep him","created_time":"2015-06-03T20:19:20+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153373127094452"},{"from":{"name":"Jim Richards","id":"977161052306222"},"message":"if there will ever be a sports team to ignore, it will be this year's Bears","created_time":"2015-06-04T16:58:43+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153374484494452"},{"from":{"name":"Jim Richards","id":"977161052306222"},"message":"what's a Slauson?","created_time":"2015-06-04T16:58:19+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153374484059452"},{"from":{"name":"Damon Harrison","id":"799655020147316"},"message":"Everyone is slamming cutler there is nothing wrong with him any qb has got to have protection if not then what stupid people","created_time":"2015-06-03T21:36:51+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153373248004452"},{"from":{"name":"Gene Flores","id":"10207007609459438"},"message":"Black unicorn still missing...come on man..him and his brother lookin like jackasses IMO","created_time":"2015-06-03T20:20:57+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153373128434452"},{"from":{"name":"Louise Crepeau Wood","id":"1131458160204383"},"message":"I will always support the Bears!","created_time":"2015-06-04T00:34:31+0000","id":"10153373088159452_10153373531844452"},{"from":{"name":"Rex Stoops","id":"10204948568218307"},"message":"Right Alexis B Gonzalez.
