With a healthy Kelce, D Anthony , Wilson, Conley , and Charles ( who can run or line up as a receiver) this should be a big problem for defenses . Most LB can't cover any of these guys on a crossing route or stop and go . I would look for a close to 4000yd for Smith and 11 Td for Macklin. I really think with what they have been showing in the OTA's , Reid is looking to open the offense up and turn it loose. I look to see multiple receiver pkgs and Charles on the move a lot . These situations create problems for defense and spread the field for big plays . I think this year will be fun to watch.
