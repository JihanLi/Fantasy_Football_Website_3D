But here are a couple things to make you feel better:\n\n1. Our reconditioning program for injured players is maybe the best in the league. just like players and coaches, doctors and staff are not all equal. See Peters and Maclin and how they lit up the league after coming back from torn ligaments. This should help us understand why Kelly isn't afraid of injury as much as the common fan.\n\n2. Mark Sanchez outplayed nick foles last year. Not by much, but he certainly did. Sure he was the qb when we were eliminated. He's also the qb that had to play Seattle, green bay and dallas twice. That's  4 games against the 3 best teams in the conference. The skins game is on him. But focus less on the w/l record and more on the fact that we have a guy who can win games when called upon as a back up. How many teams have that? \n\n3. The offense has been almost completely turned over from day 1 and has finished top 5 both years. Don't expect that to change. And the defense, who was second in sacks and decent against the run, just got a makeover on the back end. Dez toasting us for 3 and john Brown late. Remember? This was almost a 12 win team last year. And they should be as good or better on o and d and our special teams is literally the best in the league.\n\n4. We dont have to play gb or sea.\n\n5. We have the lightest travel schedule in the league.\n\nLet's get to it","created_time":"2015-07-21T18:51:39+0000","id":"926386714065769_926405537397220"},{"from":{"name":"Clayton Grant","id":"845256352188866"},"message":"As a eagles fan what the freak we gonna do at QB","created_time":"2015-07-21T17:47:13+0000","id":"926386714065769_926387047399069"},{"from":{"name":"Dave Manns Jr.","id":"937567046286378"},"message":"My prediction is that Bradfords other knee will go out on him in the preseason, Sanchez will play till about week 6 throwing about 3 INTs per game till he finally gets benched for Tebow..

They will be dominating this year if we are healthy.","created_time":"2015-07-03T13:41:53+0000","id":"918367661534341_918370788200695"},{"from":{"name":"Satish Ram Krishnaraj","id":"818612894901704"},"message":"So many people have never seen Bradford in action, when healthy, he's a beast","created_time":"2015-07-03T15:23:15+0000","id":"918367661534341_918402944864146"},{"from":{"name":"Peter Sallada","id":"10204803171537459"},"message":"We dem boyz!!!!

This is great to see and hear as a die-hard cowboys fan too. Knowing that DeMarco Murray didn't ran for no 1, 845 yards by himself last season. #WOW!!. Now he did ran behind the overall best offensive line in the whole NFL. Now we was 2nd. in run blocking. But that just one area of the offensive line.  But he wasn't even touch behind that line till he got to  the second level of the defense secondary.  Now for your pro bowler line player to make a statement like this one is big. Especially when you sign the #1 rusher from the season before. But hadn't been healthy but one season out of 4. You better hope he can stay healthy a full season after the season he just had.  Because our defense will make you beat us with the run game. Because we won't respect your passing game at all. They going ot stack the box on your team and say run Murray this way. Then on top of him selling his team out when he made that call to #ChipKelly didn't help it either. Can't wait till the 2nd game of the season. Then you might well say the cowboys offensive line now have 4 first round  players on it now. with the add of La'el Collins.","created_time":"2015-06-12T17:57:29+0000","id":"907260019311772_907830755921365"},{"from":{"name":"Ralph Hunter","id":"854375404646130"},"message":"I think our offensive line is just as good if not better than Dallas.
