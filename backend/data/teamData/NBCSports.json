I explained my problem to\nsomeone online and\nshe suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster\nthat could help me\ncast a spell to bring my fiancee back but I am the type that\nnever believed in spell,\nI had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and\nshe told me there\nwas no problem that everything will be okay before three\ndays, that my fiancee will return to me before three days, she cast the spell and\nsurprisingly in the\nsecond day, it was around 4pm. My fiancee called me, I\nwas so surprised, I answered\nthe call and all she said was that she was so sorry for\neverything that happened,\nthat she wanted me to return to me, that she loves me so\nmuch.

However Iran and western countries want to use the sectarian difference and divide Muslims.\nThey destroyed Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt and Yemen and now they are planning to execute their evil plans in Turkey.\nThis is why a bomb-suicide was executed in the eastern part of Turkey killing at least 30 people by either a member of PKK (YPG) or Isis which has no difference. Armenians and non-Muslim Kurds are providing misinformation deliberately. Those who are opposed to Sunni Muslim world are also supporting them.\nThe story is; the parliament members of HDP (political wing of PKK and YPG terrorist organizations) made a call to young people claiming to take them to Syria. They were supposed to gather in the meeting point to make a speech. The students came to the meeting point as planned. But HDP parliaments did not come. And a suicide bomb was executed at the point.\nEven a dumbest person would know this had been planned by HDP. However all the world stands against Turkey claiming the government had done it!\nAll the time the same scenario of HDP (The political wing of PKK-YPG terrorist group) is executed in the region. They launch suicide attacks against civilians and blame the government in order to earn the sympathy of voters.\nTurkey stands as the only protector of Sunni world in the region and Western powers want to remove Turkey's effect in the Middle East. West has negotiated with Iran to submit the control of whole region. Iran is their new and last favorite ally.\nThey are using Kurds and Armenians in the region and try to show them as hero with their stand against Isis.\nAlthough we know that Isis was organized by UK and its evil allies. They are lying to the whole world claiming Turkey helps Isis. Turkey is supporting opposition groups in Syria against Isıs and regime and ISIS has threatened Turkey for doing so. But still, evil plan makers are trying to calumniate Turkey over ISIS.\nI want to ask a question. Although Iraq and Syria have plain straight lands, USA keeps targeting wrong bases in airstrikes and kills opposition groups in Syria. Isis also attacks opposition groups. Assad regime makes the same. Iran and Hezbollah also. They are all targeting Turkey and Fatah Army (opposition army against regime). How would you explain this?\nThe situation in Syria is explained below;\nIran; remains against Turkey and Fatah army in the region.\nHezbollah; remains against Turkey and Fatah army in the region.\nISIS; remains against Turkey and Fatah army in the region.\nYPG and PKK; remain against Turkey and Fatah army in the region.\nUSA and Coalition; remain against Turkey and Fatah army in the region.\nTurkey with Erdogan, wants to protect the rights of Sunni people in the region, yet western powers and Iran try to prevent this. They want to use ISIS instead of Al Qaeda in order to spread and create the perception of “Islamic terrorism”. This is how they survive in the Middle East.\nAnd they know Turkey’s Erdogan is the only guy who can stand and fight against them. This is why they are executing suicide bombs inside Turkey and blaming Erdogan for supporting ISIS which actually is totally opposite. USA, YPG, Assad Regime, PKK, Hezbollah and Iran are the biggest ally of ISIS in the region. Because without ISIS, they wouldn’t be able to exist in the region. This is the summary of the story.\nThank you for reading.","created_time":"2015-07-22T22:53:15+0000","id":"864912940230726_864973723557981"},{"from":{"name":"Éimad Ajouaou
