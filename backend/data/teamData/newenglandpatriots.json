Look at back in 2003..when the Pats defense were so physical against the Colts receivers..the colts complained and wined like babies..ahhhh they are too physical..help!! smh.. What did the NFL do? Change the rules..to make receivers not get roughed up after 5 yards. And that changed the whole dynamics of the NFL..passing yards went up..etc etc. Then the Pats trick play against the Ravens..which were within the rules for crying out loud!! But because the Pats were so smart and clever..and that type of play wasnt done before..the ravens crying like babies wanting the rule changed...Now what did the NFL do? changed the rule. That Pats are too good and clever and no matter what the league does..they simply cant stop them. Goodell is nothing more than a controlled puppet...smh..waste..and who was the lead guy heading this witchhunt? Mike Kensil.......QUOTE....\" Mike Kensil, the real man behind the Deflate-Gate curtain. Kensil, who is currently the NFL’s VP of game operations, was with the New York Jets’ front office until 2006. His tenure with the team included Belichick abandoning the Jets in 2000 to build a dynasty in Foxborough, and Kensil has been butthurt ever since. So… the man who is the driving force behind the supposedly impartial investigation against the Patriots has had a personal, public vendetta against the team for the past 15 years.  AND he lied and said that the recorded PSI levels of the Patriots’ balls were so low that like the weather couldn’t possibly have been the cause of deflation. Seems kosher.\n\nThis latest revelation perfectly illustrates how this whole investigation isn’t about discovering the truth, but instead smearing the most successful franchise of the 21st century. The Patriots might not be the nicest bunch, but, at the end of the day, they’re definitely big-time winners, and people hate them for the tremendous success they’ve achieved. Deflate-Gate, as Dave Skylark would put it, is nothing more than an ugly manifestation of all that peanut butter and jealousy against New England, and hopefully, the NFL gets wise and lays off the slander before this whole thing totally explodes in their face.\"","created_time":"2015-07-29T18:02:09+0000","id":"10153529737492372_10153529768052372"},{"from":{"name":"Shannon Gfo","id":"10155916840445038"},"message":"Even if Tom Brady has to miss 4 games..I have Faith in my Patriots and Jimmy Garoppolo.

Let's start from the beginning. If the league was worried about a stupid ball than why didn't they have the officials control the balls? Now if u are worried about the integrity of the NFL than why did u set the patriots up. It was the job of the NFL officials to keep control of the balls and as far as I'm concerned u dropped the ball and the officials should be penalized. Am I the only one who feels that paying 5 million dollars to this joker for a maybe was a waste of money when that money could have been given to retired players with medical problems. All theses owners and sports talk guys are out of their minds if they think air in a football is far more important than players beating up women, doing drugs and murder.  How can u take this commissioner seriously after the smear job he did to Tom Brady and how he excused these felons. Think about this for a second. it is more important to Goodell to punish a player for air in a football and not for punching out a woman and is hiding behind the integrity of the game, say what? I guess the NFL could care less about women so what does this say about these men, maybe we should investigate them since they think it's ok to abuse women and think that's ok.","created_time":"2015-07-23T15:31:09+0000","id":"10153513104432372_10153514944217372"},{"from":{"name":"Paul Os","id":"10204097094258112"},"message":"Big fan of the Pats and big fan of the Cheer Leaders,.. but put some clothes on.","created_time":"2015-07-26T11:57:21+0000","id":"10153513104432372_10153521417567372"},{"from":{"name":"Jose Luis Martinez Chavez","id":"1634938890078975"},"message":"the best of the nfl, aal the girls","created_time":"2015-07-24T22:45:32+0000","id":"10153513104432372_10153517789447372"},{"from":{"name":"Sandy Mendrala- Table","id":"1086434681384279"},"message":"Hey, those cheerleaders don't get paid much so be kind to them!!!

You can't find someone guilty\nWith assumptions and allegations. Moron. It. Is reported that \nThe patriots used their footballs more on offense in that game\nWhich affects the psi on the balls.

Before this\nAllegation by the colts the nfl didn't pay any attention to psi\nAt all but because it's the hated patriots it's been blown\nWay out of proportion.

THE COLTS BALL PRESSURES ARE TOO HIGH (see table and explanation below)!\n\nThe Wells team used one thing to implicate the Patriots: the difference in average pressure drop from before the game, to half time, between the two teams’ balls. Unfortunately, they focused on only one of the possibilities for why there could have been a difference. They incorrectly jumped to the conclusion that the ‘problem’ was with the Patriots’ balls being too low in pressure. They did not even consider the possibility that the Colts’ balls could have been too HIGH! In fact, that is what really happened! \n\nHere are the two key things that the Wells Report missed; evidence that proves the Pats’ innocence:\n1. The reduction in pressures of the Pats’ balls is completely consistent with what was predicted to have happened via the ideal gas law, as calculated by Exponent (the independent company that did the technical analysis for the Wells report). In other words, the deflation of the Pats’ balls can be explained ENTIRELY through physics/thermodynamics with the Wells Team’s own analyses. I have no idea how this was missed in all of this sordid mess!\n2. There was a botched measurement of the half time pressures of the Colts’ balls – the referees were likely focused so much on measuring the Pats’ balls that they waited too long to measure the Colts’ balls. By that time, the Colts’ balls had warmed up enough in the locker room to increase in pressure. That is the real reason why there was a difference in pressure drop between the two teams’ balls. Unless the locker room where the Colts’ balls originally came from that day was colder than 60degF (which makes no sense), the measured pressure drop experienced by their balls violates the ideal gas law (see below for details)!\n\nThis PROVES the Pats and Brady were telling the truth the whole time; they are innocent of ANY wrongdoing.","created_time":"2015-07-01T02:22:04+0000","id":"10153457420307372_10153457908582372"},{"from":{"name":"Chris Lambert","id":"10153402156945837"},"message":"I'll support the USA until we meet you in the final..

His performance statistics give him immediate first ballot induction into The Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n  However, there is still the lingering question of how \"Deflate Gate\" will haunt him, to which, one Sports Illustrated Writer wrote an article called, \"Hall of Fame Voters on If Deflategate Will Impact Their Vote For Brady\".\n  7 out of 8 say no.  Deflate Gate does not sway their opinion on Tom Brady being immortalized.  \n  Well, what about Spy Gate?\n  Every one I ask says it had nothing to do with Brady and it was just one game.\n  Really? One Game?!  The one against the Jets that got them caught.  The one that caused them to have to pay team and personal fines, because The League became aware long before The Jets game and told The Patriots to stop.  However, they  felt they were above the league and they would only get a slap on the wrist when they got caught.  Which, that is what happened.\n  However, Senator Arlen Specter of Pa. Was about to launch a Senatorial Judiciary Investigation, of which he had the House support.  Then Goodell met with Specter, answered his questions honestly, told Specter, Belichick had been recording opposing teams walk through's for 8 years.  The tapes were destroyed and there is no evidence.  Specter left it at that.\n  Wow!  So, the greatest quarter back ever built his first 8 seasons off of receiving stolen information.  Hines Ward attest to evidence of being cheated in this link:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnKM4feYpt8\n  James Harris said on the opposite side of the ball, The Patriot Defense picked up on 90% of the Pittsburgh Blitz schemes.\n  There was a 2004 unapproved ball incident in a match between The Patriots and Miami Dolphins.\n  2004?  That was during the 8 years of spying.  So, The Patriots were mixing it up.  Trying to do everything they could to win.\n  You know what having a winning record gets a team?  Better players want to play for the better team.  Look at what is currently happening with Lebron James.  He is not resigning with The Cleveland Cavaliers.  He wants to play with better players.  He all but said that in all of his crying.\n  Brady is an illusion.  His record says \"Hall of Fame\".
