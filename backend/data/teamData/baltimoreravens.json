Yes, he has had the leadership of Ed Reed, Ray Lewis, and the rest of that Ravens team for five years but he also stepped up and played well when we absolutely needed it. Only one season have we missed the playoffs with him under center, which is much better than watching us lose every game and miss the post-season every year or have a phenomenal regular season and lose first round in playoffs. At the end of the day, Joe Flacco should be considered a top 10 QB in the NFL, bottom line, anyone who doesn't think so is foolish.","created_time":"2015-07-23T00:28:39+0000","id":"10153083980796229_10153084054221229"},{"from":{"name":"Dianne Temple","id":"1681725208722834"},"message":"Everyone of the NFL Executives are IDIOTS!","created_time":"2015-07-22T23:34:00+0000","id":"10153083980796229_10153083992161229"},{"from":{"name":"Brandon J.

One's past doesn't  have to define a person. As he said, he didn't know that people lived so differently. That is how it is in life. People are always living on the fringe, off the radar. That is not Hollywood worthy. What is really inspirational is someone who has the where with all to do the right things and have the will to do better and not fall into the trap of despair. It is also fortunate to have a helping hand along the way, whether it be a relative or stranger, but the person has to appreciate the opportunity. Even with that, it takes a strong person to fit into an alien world and do well. Javorius 'Buck' Allen has done just that. He has learned his lessons in life and that will certainly translate into his playing approach as a Raven. Hope only the best for him and hope his journey becomes easier and he reaps the rewards of his hard work and staying power.","created_time":"2015-07-12T23:37:09+0000","id":"10153063976011229_10153064284516229"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTMw","before":"MTU0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/92774416228_10153063976011229/comments?order=chronological&summary=true&access_token=CAAXEZBZArg9yEBADdhnWDPpd9V6UZBNH1lbyUXAs4kZA4jppv8DUlTkNpuPdeSLBg2YZAILgVBRZA3NlPDnOtP0eEUiJL5Q69d934kVcpzKYNCiNlyZCENXzZBQ3yDT7rXTr4UnLRwRmCc4lS1DRl9IZBivpzTvO2yoZAhVRS0GLmFd7wfCQA8EiZCJtJ2iZAKvx1AlGXxmkjZCmqJGqquToGZC1YRHqSkYyp6ZAcEZD&limit=25&after=MTMw"},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":154,"can_comment":true}}},{"name":"5 Things You May Not Know About Steve Smith Sr.","created_time":"2015-07-12T19:15:07+0000","shares":{"count":512},"link":"http://oak.ctx.ly/r/3bmgn","id":"92774416228_10153063885041229","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Stone Works","id":"1452733378385728"},{"name":"Kathy Calender","id":"903798156324478"},{"name":"Jess√∫s Denicia","id":"625604984243615"},{"name":"Joshua Rivera","id":"1624506951136236"},{"name":"Eva Hayes","id":"1649091288635877"},{"name":"Amberlee Files","id":"1097055017027890"},{"name":"Jayden Burke","id":"957472667630027"},{"name":"Mary Short","id":"10204706345165362"},{"name":"Emiliano Ikal Rivera","id":"1463461743976131"},{"name":"Dwayne Thomas","id":"1043596902341663"},{"name":"Daphney Bourdeau","id":"870303053051694"},{"name":"Danny Xiong","id":"650877285047676"},{"name":"Ryan Adu","id":"889929211086757"},{"name":"Brian Allen Guy","id":"542311279254623"},{"name":"Daniel Robinson","id":"1453410381652261"},{"name":"Victoria Nilsen","id":"662831563854112"},{"name":"Christy Brown","id":"1642650392645693"},{"name":"Tony Santos","id":"730861730357075"},{"name":"Toni White","id":"10207400362267747"},{"name":"Raul Fonseca Torres","id":"1084915991536142"},{"name":"Marcelle Leimbach","id":"10206224339601522"},{"name":"Collis Hawkins","id":"10153227860968445"},{"name":"Teddy Nelson","id":"847645081991516"},{"name":"Jorge Sanchez Lopez","id":"847171395337873"},{"name":"Toby Jones","id":"939663959434147"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"OTM5NjYzOTU5NDM0MTQ3","before":"MTQ1MjczMzM3ODM4NTcyOA=="},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/92774416228_10153063885041229/likes?summary=true&fields=name&access_token=CAAXEZBZArg9yEBADdhnWDPpd9V6UZBNH1lbyUXAs4kZA4jppv8DUlTkNpuPdeSLBg2YZAILgVBRZA3NlPDnOtP0eEUiJL5Q69d934kVcpzKYNCiNlyZCENXzZBQ3yDT7rXTr4UnLRwRmCc4lS1DRl9IZBivpzTvO2yoZAhVRS0GLmFd7wfCQA8EiZCJtJ2iZAKvx1AlGXxmkjZCmqJGqquToGZC1YRHqSkYyp6ZAcEZD&limit=25&after=OTM5NjYzOTU5NDM0MTQ3"},"summary":{"total_count":4689,"can_like":true,"has_liked":false}},"comments":{"data":[{"from":{"name":"Ricardo Ledezma","id":"937718666279791"},"message":"Bears fan here but I love the Ravens, too.
