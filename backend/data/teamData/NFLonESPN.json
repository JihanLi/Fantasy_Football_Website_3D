The bills defense will be extremely lethal and they will have a elite running attack in LeSean McCoy and Fred Jackson coming back healthy. Jets have one of the best front 7s in the NFL. Todd Bowles will bring another level of toughness and discipline to this football team. With the additions of Darrelle Revis, Antonio Cromartie, and Brandon Marshall, they can be sensational on both sides of the ball. Finally, The Dolphins got Ndamokong Suh from Detroit as well as Cameron Wake, one of the best 3-4 defensive ends in The league. All 3 of those teams have lethal defenses but the bills and the jets have HUGE question marks at QB. I'd bet on the Bills and the Jets to win the AFC East if their QBs can step up and produce. If they can't, I'd bet on the Patriots to win because of Tom Brady coming back motivated and hungry.

The NFL fined Brett Favre $50,000 for not cooperating by turning over his phone in 2010 with regards to sending nude texts. If they go after that, Brady will win. If they do sue, they will seek an immediate injunction so Brady can play week 1 up until the federal judge decides on his suspension. Only bad part about that is if the judge rules later in the season and says he should only miss 1 game or 2, he may have to serve them in December while in a playoff push rather than the start of the season.","created_time":"2015-07-28T20:02:34+0000","id":"879447695486932_879496898815345"},{"from":{"name":"Nate Studley","id":"915554508491324"},"message":"I love the fact that the only divisional game played without tom Brady is against the bills","created_time":"2015-07-28T19:34:27+0000","id":"879447695486932_879477132150655"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ3","before":"Njcy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/104445666320476_879447695486932/comments?order=chronological&summary=true&access_token=CAAXEZBZArg9yEBADdhnWDPpd9V6UZBNH1lbyUXAs4kZA4jppv8DUlTkNpuPdeSLBg2YZAILgVBRZA3NlPDnOtP0eEUiJL5Q69d934kVcpzKYNCiNlyZCENXzZBQ3yDT7rXTr4UnLRwRmCc4lS1DRl9IZBivpzTvO2yoZAhVRS0GLmFd7wfCQA8EiZCJtJ2iZAKvx1AlGXxmkjZCmqJGqquToGZC1YRHqSkYyp6ZAcEZD&limit=25&after=NjQ3"},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":672,"can_comment":true}}},{"created_time":"2015-07-28T18:41:35+0000","shares":{"count":6745},"link":"https://www.facebook.com/NFLonESPN/photos/a.104466009651775.5921.104445666320476/879419422156426/?type=1","id":"104445666320476_879419422156426","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Bea Furman Prosper","id":"1156015757748804"},{"name":"Miguel Castro","id":"10152963511096837"},{"name":"Michelle Mohr","id":"10207233188329162"},{"name":"Stephen Bond","id":"10154021253527506"},{"name":"Mary Cota","id":"10205108352775154"},{"name":"Amanda Christner McFarland","id":"10154137027423712"},{"name":"George Austin","id":"758362200952737"},{"name":"Mani Mamut Ruiz","id":"1440280339633786"},{"name":"Jack Patton","id":"422631717922744"},{"name":"Brandon Martins","id":"521462454671975"},{"name":"Everett Gunter","id":"394196647456026"},{"name":"Daniel Pulecio","id":"10153625313793777"},{"name":"Tim Davis","id":"1184099141606872"},{"name":"Robin Wiseman","id":"934482543260088"},{"name":"Cooper Hicks","id":"1608262289423581"},{"name":"Derrick Meade","id":"411917168995563"},{"name":"Bradford Goode","id":"1116272685052833"},{"name":"Benny Terrientes","id":"10206205301104293"},{"name":"Chris Aaron","id":"1028269117186020"},{"name":"George Singleton","id":"971605922903950"},{"name":"Chad Sandifer","id":"656787324422326"},{"name":"Charlie Burnett Ewing","id":"1021162767893909"},{"name":"Elaine Augustine Steinegger","id":"10207062416538063"},{"name":"Josh Anyiwo","id":"10101508986436217"},{"name":"Kenneth J.

Once training camp starts, he needs to be able to focus on getting himself and the team ready for next season, not worrying about contract negotiations. Seahawks management isn't stupid. We've got a hell of a team, but a team isn't much good without a stellar quarterback. They'll agree to a contract eventually, and Wilson definitely deserves to get paid for what he's done for us already. He's on track to be recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, but he's not there yet. Asking to be paid on the same scale as Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and the like is a little premature in my opinion.

First off the rules were that the refs always had total control and choice of what footballs were going to be used during game day, and the NFL Teams didn't start suppling their own choice of footballs until the rule changed in 2006, so with that being said, the argument of all the super bowls being tainted is NULL, VOIDED & INVALID.

There's a Collective Bargaining Agreement and in it the players gave Roger Goodell and his advisors say over punishments that have to do with player conduct and actions detrimental to the league (such as cheating). So if Goodell says the suspension stands or reduces it to two games, there's not much that the NFLPA can do about it. They negotiated the CBA. They allowed for Goodell to have this power. \n\nFrom what I've read, most of the players believe that Brady was complicit in the cheating. Many of them want to see him punished because he's the face of the league and it's not like the Pats have a clean past in the Brady/Belichick era. Suspending Brady doesn't just punish Brady, it's the ultimate punishment for the team because it forces them to play without their best player. \n\nTaking away draft picks doesn't faze them. Fining the team (owner) and coach doesn't matter because it's just a drop in the bucket to them.

The deadline is Wednesday, July 15th, at 3pm Central time. If no long-term deal is reached by then, Jerry Jones can't simply pay Dez more later this year, even if Dez chooses to sit. In other words, if Dez sits, he just loses money and hurts the team, but he won't get paid more. This is not like when Emmitt Smith held out in 1993 and got a big deal after the Cowboys started 0-2.\n\n2. Dez cannot go to any other team. That's how the franchise tag works. I have seen this on a lot of threads elsewhere (\"He would look great in a Vikings jersey\" was a comment I saw yesterday). This will not happen in 2015. Dez will play for the Cowboys, or he will not play at all. Additionally, they can franchise tag him next year as well if they choose to do so, but not in 2017.\n\nLastly, has anyone considered what would happen if Dez chose to sit out for a couple of games and the Cowboys went 2-0? Just interested to hear your thoughts.\n\nMy guess is that the deal, if any, will be announced on Wednesday around lunchtime. If there is no deal, Dez will sign the franchise tag, miss training camp, but he will play week 1 against the Giants.","created_time":"2015-07-14T14:29:49+0000","id":"872535719511463_872555346176167"},{"from":{"name":"Jesse Luna","id":"956392461050884"},"message":"Wow and now you all are comparing him to Emmitt Smith!
