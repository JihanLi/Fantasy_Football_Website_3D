They allowed to many catches and runs waltz right by them. Levy and Tahir had a good season last year.  Levy leading the league in tackles last year.  I would like to see more intensity from Deandre Levy.  He's got to convince me he can stay fierce at linebacker.  I want to see him attack whoever has the football. If he does that then he will be a killer.   I also thought they were slow as hell in zone plays.  We need to see a little more hustle and bustle when they are in zone plays. I think the LB's and DB's need to read and get to  the ball more quickly.  QB's were picking them apart (Tom Brady, Aaron Rogers now they play Payton, Colin, Aaron, Breese and Russle this year).  Especially when they were playing man to man coverage.  The push from the D- line last year really helped the LB's improve with their assignments (now they have Ngata who now knew the Ravens D? are you for real?).  If they continue with that we will see some major improvements from not only the LB's but from the entire defense. They would most certainly see more picks and sacks. Overall I think this stable of LB's can continue to spark some magic.  This defense is most certainly promising.","created_time":"2015-07-27T17:02:55+0000","id":"10153436336783605_10153436543378605"},{"from":{"name":"Gizelle Ross","id":"1153570861325063"},"message":"Can't wait for the season to start go Lions 🏉","created_time":"2015-07-27T15:38:51+0000","id":"10153436336783605_10153436389538605"},{"from":{"name":"Caleb Dewey","id":"879964078753846"},"message":"Lets be real...our linebacker corp has been average at best.

Now I do not think Children Mott Hospital would be very happy if we REALLY had hundreds of people show up to surprise David. So we are asking that you mail him a get well, encouragement card or Birthday card. We will be collecting cards for David NOW until Aug 15 th. We will hide them! This will be tricky but we are determined to keep this a secret! The goal is to receive cards from ALL OVER THE WORLD We want David to know that people from all over are \"smiling\" for him!! Please send him a card to show your support. It can be a simple get well card with words of encouragement,or a birthday card. PLEASE invite your family, co-workers and friends to Davids Party !!! We will give David his cards and video tape his reaction and opening of cards,and will post on his Facebook. We have a volunteer that has offered to have this made into a little video. We will send copies of this video to other children when they are ready to have Cleft/bone graph surgery. With words of encouragement from one Cleft Warrior to another !!! We encourage you to celebrate with us!!!!

Who's he supposed to throw the ball too? 4. The WRs lead the league in drops for the millionth year in a row. So when he does make a perfect pass, it gets dropped. 5. They had no running game. Therefore, defenses played against the pass all game every game.....We all seen what he can do with a healthy OLine and when he is given time to throw. 5,000+ yards 40+ TDs.....I'd love to see a Stafford hater try to argue against anything I just said.

He finally had a good defense and we won 11 games, go figure. If we continue to support him by playing good defense, running the ball some, and staying healthy, I believe that he is good enough to get us to a Super Bowl. \nHe has all of the talent needed, he has weapons, has a line, has talent on the other side of the ball  and we can now see if he is capable of continuing to improve. He's not leaving, he's committed to Detroit, and we need to give him his chance to show us why we made him a #1 Overall.

He's the quickest qb to 20,000 yards. His td to int rate is up there with some of the best. When he had a good running game (Best) he put up elite numbers. I believe our new kid we picked up in the draft may be our new Best. I don't expect much for the kid his rookie year, but if he can just stay healthy, other teams defences will have to respect his speed and shiftyness. They'll have to stack the box. That'll open it up more for our receivers. We should see a big improvement on offence this year.","created_time":"2015-07-05T00:49:50+0000","id":"10153383384538605_10153384544578605"},{"from":{"name":"Michael Schlosser","id":"966019660117086"},"message":"Stafford is a good an they will fine","created_time":"2015-07-05T12:03:23+0000","id":"10153383384538605_10153385852628605"},{"from":{"name":"Dione Summers","id":"894158397298668"},"message":"Time to become the ELITE QB I've (we've ) been waiting for!","created_time":"2015-07-04T17:20:38+0000","id":"10153383384538605_10153383433068605"},{"from":{"name":"Die-Lawn Clark","id":"10206085243284208"},"message":"","created_time":"2015-07-04T19:45:00+0000","id":"10153383384538605_10153383782563605"},{"from":{"name":"David Folk II","id":"1676329405922659"},"message":"","created_time":"2015-07-05T00:16:47+0000","id":"10153383384538605_10153384497943605"},{"from":{"name":"John Thompson","id":"869717283135815"},"message":"Because he no longer has a defense with Suh gone and he is going to have to offer some offense to make up for a lack of defense.","created_time":"2015-07-04T17:18:50+0000","id":"10153383384538605_10153383428303605"},{"from":{"name":"Brandon Epperson","id":"10153707827327985"},"message":"Love the top 10 explosive plays by Lions 2014.
