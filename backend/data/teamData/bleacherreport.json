I'm a spurs fan. My opinion is seeing this gems that the lakers got they have a formidable future. Clarkson is the real deal among them. He can be a shooting guard and play like  Dwayne Wade with his tenacity and aggressiveness.  He can also play point guard with the comparison of Russell Westbrook and Andre Miller. He has a very good awareness on both ends. And take note his coachable.  D' angelo Russell has a lot of potential. Also he is a lefty. He can shoot the perimeter with a good shooting stroke and can really pass the ball. The reason lakers got him is they knew they can't get towns who is really their first option. Okafor is a good player but I can see there's an attitude problem especially when he got drafted by the sixers. But I think lakers got the right player because for me look at the hornets when they drafted Cody Zeller because they think he has a polish game. Again it's my opinion. We don't know if okafor would be a beast. But all I know is russell would be a long time starter but comparing him to Jordan Clarkson I I would say right now that we haven't seen russell play in a regular NBA game, I would say Jordan Clarkson has the edge. Lakers is not a garbage team. Do you know the word rebuild? It's very difficult to rebuild knowing that you are a winning club so let them. Anyways all our opinions are not valid. Let's just wait for the regular season season to start.

Shaq was ALWAYS hurt and never played a full season in 19 seasons missing 351 games to injury . He played for six teams and all many remember are his dunks or nicknames but his teams were swept many times in the playoffs from the first round to the NBA finals.  He was the first NBA champ to be swept in the first round the next year . without other great players and coaches he was so one dimensional would have been zero championships . He was never clutch . 4-2 in finals . Lots of big men with more blocks , rebounds , points and championships . He would be third best at center on the Lakers behind Wilt and Kareem . No Dwayne Wade and Pat Riley no 4th championship . He talks about Scottie being a sidekick . 6-0 in finals for Pippen . As good as Shaq was he could have , SHOULD have been better . Not clutch . He was a weakness as much as a strength for the teams he was on . Pippen and the Bulls swept and shut him down in the playoffs . Had the best record in NBA history . Won six titles and zero losses in the championship and never had an all star at center or point guard . Only Pippen, Jordan and the Bulls can say that . They didn't need Shaq or any other all star center . Shaq is 8th all time in blocks behind Ewing , Duncan , Robinson , Eaton , Jabbar , Mutombo and #1 Olajuwon who head to head swept Shaq in the NBA finals . Shaq is 14th all time in rebounds almost 11000 rebounds behind #1 Wilt Chamberlin . Shaq is 6th all time in scoring . Dirk Nowitzki will pass him this year putting him at 7th. If Duncan plays 2 more years at his average he will also pass Shaq and is already ahead of him in rebounds , Blocks and NBA championships at 5-1 in the finals . Shaq was like Andre the Giant , a huge entertaining spectacle that wasn't the best at anything or the fastest or the winningest but made for great spectacle and some entertaining moments , as he is slowly pushed further and further down the line in all stats in the record books as more talented and more winning players come and go he will always be remembered for his size , strength and bravado ( and nicknames ) but best all time and not needing or being a sidekick ?

The WWE needs a booking team and creative team that is first and for most true wrestlings fans and that knows what the WWE Universe wants to see. I know Vince has the last say so but if you give him great ideas he will run with it. The stuff with Summer and Lana and Rusev was awful and a complete waste of time. Stuff like that doesn't need any TV TIME because it's garbage. Summerslam I hope is going to be booked right since it's a 4 hour PPV and I hope it don't have a bunch of crap just thrown together.
