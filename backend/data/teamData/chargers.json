Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the More- government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. apparently, if u copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have the best day of ur life tomorrow. u will either get kissed or asked out, if u break this chain u will see a little dead girl in your room tonight. in 53 mins someone will say i love you or im sorry WARNING IF YOU STOP READING YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT. Hi I'm Mike. I'm 11 years old but I'm dead now. I had no friends... If you do not post this to 20 pictures you will die tonight at exactly 11:59pm.DON'T BELIEVE ME?A guy named Jake read this and laughedlater that night I took a knife from his kitchen and stabbed him to death.

They aren't relevant to one another. The 2010 \"policy\" prohibiting Sydney Seau to speak was NOT established as a precedent for future decisions & was meant to prohibit redundant information in speeches for posthumous inductees, thereby shortening the event for broadcasting purposes. The NFL owes EVERY HOF inductee the opportunity to be introduced by a loved one whether they are alive or not. Junior's daughter wants to honor her father & has no intentions of speaking negatively about the NFL during the induction ceremony. The legal aspects should be left to the courts. Junior gave everything he had to the sport and the NFL profited tremendously off of his dedication to football. Regardless of the concussion lawsuit or statements made by a player who was obviously fighting to keep his job, the Seau Family deserves to speak on behalf of their loved one who earned his way in to the NFL Hall of Fame by way of blood, sweat, tears & sacrifice unmatched by 99% of anyone who has ever played the game.

They aren't relevant to one another. The 2010 \"policy\" prohibiting Sydney Seau to speak was NOT established as a precedent for future decisions & was meant to prohibit redundant information in speeches for posthumous inductees, thereby shortening the event for broadcasting purposes. The NFL owes EVERY HOF inductee the opportunity to be introduced by a loved one whether they are alive or not. Junior's daughter wants to honor her father & has no intentions of speaking negatively about the NFL during the induction ceremony. The legal aspects should be left to the courts. Junior gave everything he had to the sport and the NFL profited tremendously off of his dedication to football. Regardless of the concussion lawsuit or statements made by a player who was obviously fighting to keep his job, the Seau Family deserves to speak on behalf of their loved one who earned his way in to the NFL Hall of Fame by way of blood, sweat, tears & sacrifice unmatched by 99% of anyone who has ever played the game. The least you can do Commissioner Goodell, is allow Junior's daughter Sydney to speak on his behalf at the Hall of Fame ceremony on August 8th, 2015.

Junior's daughter wants to honor her father & has no intentions of speaking negatively about the NFL during the induction ceremony. The legal aspects should be left to the courts. Junior gave everything he had to the sport and the NFL profited tremendously off of his dedication to football. Regardless of the concussion lawsuit or statements made by a player who was obviously fighting to keep his job, the Seau Family deserves to speak on behalf of their loved one who earned his way in to the NFL Hall of Fame by way of blood, sweat, tears & sacrifice unmatched by 99% of anyone who has ever played the game. The least you can do Commissioner Goodell, is allow Junior's daughter Sydney to speak on his behalf at the Hall of Fame ceremony on August 8th, 2015.

This was not a very well organized run. The Bolt to the Q has never been a crown jewel among local runs, but it's been fun and 'good enough' and unique so as to keep me coming back. Sadly, this year was just dreadful in my opinion (as far as races go, this is a first-world problem in the grand scheme of things of course, but since I paid for it, I'm going to vent). \nThe 10K was poorly integrated, there was confusion about who was starting when, and where and how to line up. The giant long pen with one primary entrance at the rear (and not well marked) with a tiny unmarked 3 foot opening ahead of the 10K group, everything was just so poorly organized. I felt bad for the fast 10k'ers who then had to swim through the 5K walkers and don't get me started at having water stations at 1.5 and 2 miles. Really? Spacing out those water stations by a half mile? So very helpful.  Normally I wouldn't care but on such an unusually hot and muggy morning. Re-using the same water station for the out and back was pretty no bueno.\nUltimately, this one gave me the impression that the organizers were pretty much \"well, this is the last one of these we'll be hosting so, save as much money as possible because it doesn't matter what impression we leave behind, we don't have to worry about a decline for next year's event since there won't be one.

They aren't relevant to one another. The 2010 \"policy\" prohibiting Sydney Seau to speak was NOT established as a precedent for future decisions & was meant to prohibit redundant information in speeches for posthumous inductees, thereby shortening the event for broadcasting purposes. The NFL owes EVERY HOF inductee the opportunity to be introduced by a loved one whether they are alive or not. Junior's daughter wants to honor her father & has no intentions of speaking negatively about the NFL during the induction ceremony. The legal aspects should be left to the courts. Junior gave everything he had to the sport and the NFL profited tremendously off of his dedication to football. Regardless of the concussion lawsuit or statements made by a player who was obviously fighting to keep his job, the Seau Family deserves to speak on behalf of their loved one who earned his way in to the NFL Hall of Fame by way of blood, sweat, tears & sacrifice unmatched by 99% of anyone who has ever played the game.

Would you be OK with that? Would you be OK with those men and women taking photos of her while she was naked and then putting it out there for the world to see? Would you spend money watching and supporting an organization that exploits women like that?\n\nIf not, then why do you support male pro-sports that exploits naked male athletes in exactly that way? The media presence in the locker room has made male pro-sports an exploitive, ugly, vulgar naked beefcake show. And you pay for it? There have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man up” by management and media. It’s the same shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sandusky’s and Graham James’s of this world. So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. That’s the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys.

The NFL owes EVERY HOF inductee the opportunity to be introduced by a loved one whether they are alive or not. Junior's daughter wants to honor her father & has no intentions of speaking negatively about the NFL during the induction ceremony. The legal aspects should be left to the courts. Junior gave everything he had to the sport and the NFL profited tremendously off of his dedication to football. Regardless of the concussion lawsuit or statements made by a player who was obviously fighting to keep his job, the Seau Family deserves to speak on behalf of their loved one who earned his way in to the NFL Hall of Fame by way of blood, sweat, tears & sacrifice unmatched by 99% of anyone who has ever played the game.
