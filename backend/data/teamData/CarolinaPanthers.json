I am also not sold on the depth behind Harper and Boston. Our back four (or five in nickel) is easily the Achilles heel to what we can bring in our front seven. Everyone proclaiming a number 1 defense, or even top 5, send to forget that we have virtually brand new CBs, two are old and coming off serious injuries, we have two DTs coming of injury with very old guys providing depth there, we have one proven DE with about four guys fighting for time opposite Charles Johnson, and our safeties consist of an aging guy (albeit coming off a solid year) and a very young guy with tubs of potential. There are a lot of questions about this team, even on our strong side of the ball. While I fully expect a strong showing from our defense I don't think providing them best on the league makes any sense...yet. Also, if our offense and special teams plays poorly and consistently puts our defense out there on a short field with little rest, our great defensive players will not perform at their great levels of play. I see our offense as a handicap for our defense, which is why I think we will see a significant drop in wins this year. Hopefully when they start hitting these questions will be answered though and that feeling will change.","created_time":"2015-07-27T12:10:34+0000","id":"1023292617683744_1023489557664050"},{"from":{"name":"Hunter Johnson","id":"10207268169285826"},"message":"Tre Boston is the real deal!!","created_time":"2015-07-27T01:33:20+0000","id":"1023292617683744_1023294167683589"},{"from":{"name":"Mario Youngblood","id":"10101075873562947"},"message":"We need to sign Evan Mathis to boost the oline","created_time":"2015-07-27T02:20:55+0000","id":"1023292617683744_1023314721014867"},{"from":{"name":"Mark Carico","id":"1121548474526323"},"message":"Since 1997, I've seen the the safety position as the weekest link for Carolina.

But we were wondering about parking/tailgating, and whether tailgating continues into the night after the game is over at 11:30.

My Mother Elizabeth Berdan lived on base at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and lost a baby girl that lived for 6 months before finally dying from a Birth Defect. This Traumatized her forever, She is one of Thousands of Women who lived at Camp Lejeune and Lost Children or Gave Birth to Children with Birth Defects. The EPA has proven the Poisonous Toxicity of the Ground Water in Camp Lejeune, and it comes from the United States Marine Corps intentionally dumping Fuel, Industrial Cleaners and Solvents, Benzene, and other Toxic Waste into the water for disposal! The long term Effects of the Contamination at Camp Lejeune caused a vast array of Diseases To The Marine Corps Soldiers who served at Camp Lejeune as well as Civilians living on base in Jacksonville North Carolina. Marines and Civilians all Suffer Daily from afflictions directly caused by the contaminated Water in Camp Lejeune. These afflictions include the following: Bladder cancer, Miscarriage, Breast cancer, Multiple myeloma, Esophageal cancer, Myelodysplastic syndromes, Female infertility, Neurobehavioral effects, Hepatic steatosis, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Kidney cancer, Renal toxicity, Leukemia, Scleroderma, Lung Cancer and Many Other Reported Abnormalities. My Mother is an Army Veteran, and my Father, is former Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Daniel Smith, He Served America for 12 years at Camp Lejuene ----Fixing and flying with the CH-46 E Helicopters that Protect Us,,,,, My Dad was exposed to this water, and he is dying from it. My Step-Sister was born with strange rare diseases, and so were her children NOW I FIND OUT MY SISTER'S DAUGHTER HAD A TUMOR IN HER SPINE ATTACHED TO HER BRAINSTEM!!!!!! ITS NO WONDER WHY!!!!!!!! THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS PROVEN THIS!!!!THE WATER AT CAMP LEJEUNE WAS POISON!!!!!Many Soldiers were exposed and Our Government has blocked the Marines(AND Civilians) in Court from ever getting compensation for these injuries!!!!!!!!!! They have a system they claim is doing justice, but this is 100% not the Case, With an International Investigation it would be proven that The United States Government is intentionally lying to avoid costs. Thousands of people are dying from this (Marine Corps Soldiers and Civilians)and have died already while sitting on this fake waiting list for benefits.
