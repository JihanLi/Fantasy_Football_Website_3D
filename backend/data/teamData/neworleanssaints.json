She was given a less than 5% chance of survival by the MFM doctor due to having poor lung development. Needless to say, the odds were stacked against her from the very beginning. The doctors told us that once the \"cord was cut\" that Carsyn would either fight to live or die. How does a parent prepare for something like this? You really don't. You just have to believe in God and pray for the best possible outcome. Luckily she survived the birth process and was rushed to the NICU. The wonderful doctors and nurses stayed with her until she was stable enough to breath with the assistance of a vent. For three months my wife and I drove to NOLA from Baton Rouge daily to let our daughter know that we were there for her. For the days that we could not make it (due to work obligations or our other children), we thanked God for the NicView Cameras provided by the Brees Dream foundation. It allowed not only my wife and I to watch over her, but our immediate family. Drew Brees is an incredible person on and off the field. His foundation and the wonderful things that his family does for the city and others around the country do not go unnoticed. Thank you Drew for your kindness. It is people like you who make this world a wonderful place.

Tey were exactly right. All this train camp extravaganza. A team coming off a year so embarrassing.  Acting like they are entitled to a paycheck laughing there way to the bank and not showing up on Sunday. Cannot win games but can wrestle crocodiles. Your 20 mill a year well soent. Playing the glamor role. No proof in pudding. Thier own sign \"Do your job\" anything but. Did anyone watch the games last year? We will do some live streaming from our luxurious triangle camp as we sit in our Jacuzzis collecting our doe from the work for a living folks of N.O. we got it made while those 9 to 5 and more folks who think we are actually going to put forth effort kiss our butts. Time to clean house and get rid of all these fools. We deserve a winner not jokes on the field. Do your job or let us find replacements that will. Win games. Countless time heard commentators say \" Saints just stand around with hands on hips like they could care or less.\" They are not haters. They said what they saw. The reallity of it. Flat out embarrassment.  Send Payton, Brees and company on their way time. Play till 45. I would test him too. How many interceptions can one possibly throw from his own 20 where D just smiled and waived allowing to convert to score on same pay or next. . Jimmy Graham pulling up short on timing patterns and standing watch the ball hit the ground. Good riddance. Reallity of it all. Their time is done  and they are milking it. They are taking  our faith and support cashing in  before we catch on. Reallity of it.  Planning for retirement and building that  nest egg. All just my opinion of course. Take a long hard look though.","created_time":"2015-07-21T06:01:03+0000","id":"905253886188844_905394486174784"},{"from":{"name":"JoAnna Reynolds","id":"10153704565221874"},"message":"I DON'T KNOW ABOUT Y'ALL BUT GO SAINTS ! !","created_time":"2015-07-20T22:40:12+0000","id":"905253886188844_905267199520846"},{"from":{"name":"Jason Eppley","id":"887670407936153"},"message":"Are photographers allowed to photograph the Metairie practices?
