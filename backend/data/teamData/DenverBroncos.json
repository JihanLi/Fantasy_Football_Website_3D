Kubiak's system hasn't ever done good unless the O line can block and the RB excels. Anderson is good, but hasn't proved he can be good against 7 and 8 man boxes or even draw them to open the passing lanes and slow the pass rush from a fear that he can actually break loose for a big gain. It is irresponsible to not bring in a higher regarded veteran while he is there just bc you want to bring young guys along. If those young guys don't perform at a high level and don't do their job then Elway and the head coach has failed the Broncos, Manning, and the fans. If they try this with young guys and it doesn't work and there is nobody to get that we could've got when Clady went down then it will say that this front office and coaching staff are nothing special and not capable of analysing talent and needs on this team. The O line was already the biggest question, now it is more of a question. Most of America can realize and already realizes that this O line is pathetic and are scratching their heads wondering what the new coach and Elway are doing. It is a shame to not have somebody ready that can perform at a high level if TY can't which is most likely the outcome based on the college game for the combine. Chris Clark already showed you can't rely on him so there is nobody for LT bc TY is too weak. Clark got pushed around and allowed pressure within a half second against the Seahawks. There was another team that he got pushed around playing also a couple seasons ago.","created_time":"2015-07-29T19:28:05+0000","id":"10153549670606318_10153550051646318"},{"from":{"name":"Bernard DeFusco","id":"1003241536367251"},"message":"Glad to hear he is back!","created_time":"2015-07-29T16:35:58+0000","id":"10153549670606318_10153549679086318"},{"from":{"name":"Lelah Henning","id":"900498273357784"},"message":"Glad Eric Berry is back.","created_time":"2015-07-29T19:49:39+0000","id":"10153549670606318_10153550104711318"},{"from":{"name":"Shelby T Mitchell","id":"10155835294795285"},"message":"Good news on Eric!","created_time":"2015-07-29T17:51:37+0000","id":"10153549670606318_10153549855966318"},{"from":{"name":"Nathan Roberts","id":"10204826872892893"},"message":"HE'S COMIN TO GETCHA, PEYPEY!!! lol","created_time":"2015-07-29T16:52:59+0000","id":"10153549670606318_10153549706791318"},{"from":{"name":"MaRia Vasquez England","id":"10203165950228807"},"message":"This is great news!!!","created_time":"2015-07-29T20:24:52+0000","id":"10153549670606318_10153550169761318"},{"from":{"name":"Donnie J.

It happens all the time when the big college studs come to the NFL and have the spotlight on them, but it doesn't last long. \n\nCam Newton was one of the worst until he got picked on and destroyed by defenses. Especially Von Miller. Von pretty much ended Cam's cockiness with one amazing game and definitely one of Von's best games haha.  But now Cam has calmed down and acts like a Pro, that I know of. \n\nShane Ray could come in cocky this season and get torched by opposing offenses and deflate his ego to bring him back down to Earth, which would be good cause then he'd train even harder to avoid that happening again. Or he might come in cocky and make his presence on the field known in the NFL and win Defensive Rookie of the Year. All I want from him is to get better and better and help us win games.\n\nI'm still so excited to see him and Von going after the opposing QB together. If Shane transitions really well into the NFL, Miller and Ray will be one of, if not the best and scariest duos in the NFL. Imagine two Von Millers on the field at the same time, both of them competing against each other (friendly competing) to get more tackles, sacks, INTs, forced fumbles, TDs, etc. and to get better, faster, and stronger with each game that passes.

Getting rid of Fox losing our top TD and all the other changes that have been going on. I believe its a case of trial an error. Elay keeps making some of the best draft decisions in the NFL. Building on our Offensive line to get Manning the protection he needs and deserves. Changing up our Defensive scheme which Ware is better at playing in. A New coach that is going to give a less conservative game strategy in General. Overall I think Elway is looking at our week spots building and improving on them. Also looking at our strong areas and seeing what else we can through into the mix. Making us that much more unpredictable and overall a dangerous threat and a force to be reckoned with in the NFL. If we aren't the best team in the NFL then just wait because we are the most resilient team in the NFL and we are only going to get better. #DBFAN4LIFE #GOBRONCOS","created_time":"2015-07-28T16:02:29+0000","id":"10153545758466318_10153547638316318"},{"from":{"name":"Jovi J-Ace Phan","id":"1117888268225234"},"message":"But we are all gonna act like Odell beckham is better then Demaryius??

Every other successful GM drafts O lineman in the First round and at least O lineman that can start and are strong enough to start unlike TY. Our O line is so horrible it's pathetic to call it an O line for a NFL team. The O line has hindered us and got worse each year, and Elway can't draft a starter and he can't sign a starter now that it's worse than ever. You can't expect signing one RG to keep the whole O line floating. Even before Clady's injury, Clady himself said he was performing sub par. There were plenty of reasons before then to address the O line. Yet Elway trades for the worse rated Center in the league and signs another backup at LG in Shelley Smith who played awful while over paying him a lot and guaranteed him one million dollars in bonus money. He did that when we already had a backup LG, but was in need of a starting LG like the one he let walk who performed the best on the O line last year. So this suspension is the least of my worries and I can't be more mad at him than Elway for failing this team year after year by basically not even having an O line out there. Manning and the Broncos have accomplished a lot, but if Elway would do his job and get an actual starting caliber O line the Broncos could've won the Superbowl at least twice now with Manning. Manning has to carry this team and play QB and O line at the same time. It's beyond ridiculous to not have the O line any better by now, and it's a pure shame that it is worse now. If this was somebody besides Elway he would be out the door already for even thinking about the O line we have as being suitable to play on this level and allow it to hurt and drag down the entire team! Swallow your pride Elway and make an attempt at trading for Andrew Whitworth or sign Jake Long. Signing both is more reasonable than trying to play a bunch of guys that aren't ready on the O line while trying to win the Superbowl.","created_time":"2015-07-25T05:03:23+0000","id":"10153539080291318_10153540000456318"},{"from":{"name":"Katie Vancleave","id":"865458463542612"},"message":"Wolfe can not be replaced.

I believe Manning will play next season at a minimum and possibly 3 or 4 more seasons, and Broncos Country better hope and pray that he does play that many, and ask God to lay His hand of protection on him and to help Manning. Elway needs to get an O line for Manning. Manning has carried all his team's and done it with less. He has made receivers and TE's while playing QB, O line, and Offensive Coordinator at the same time. He has done it with no run game, poor O lines, not the best coaches but not all were bad either, and played most of his career without a good defense. He is the best and why he has accomplished so much and is the leagues only 5 time MVP and should've been more, like in 2012 when AP got it bc Manning already won it 4 times at that point, so the next year Manning plays at such an elite level that he had to be voted MVP for the 5th time. He put up those kind of numbers last year with no O line while the defense underwhelmed in performance. Manning usually plays QB and O line at the same time and he is the only QB to play at an elite level with basically no O line that couldn't block a single person for any amount of time to help run a play.","created_time":"2015-07-25T05:28:16+0000","id":"10153537702476318_10153540023096318"},{"from":{"name":"Sean Alves","id":"10204835051905204"},"message":"Elway is best, Peyton top 10 nothing more.","created_time":"2015-07-25T07:53:38+0000","id":"10153537702476318_10153540145866318"},{"from":{"name":"Judy Horton Hanna","id":"10204542822958567"},"message":"Considering the QB as the leader of the offense, a player that makes other players on the team better, who works harder and studies longer, Peyton Manning is undeniably the best of all time.

This is pathetic and poor management to not invest more in the O line and risk it dragging the team down again, and hindering the team. Manning has to do enough playing QB and carrying the team without a lot of help in years past. He shouldn't have to play O line and QB at the same time as he has had to do. It's a shame to assemble this team and to have to much pride to admit you have failed to build a starting NFL caliber O line and let that keep you from bringing in NFL starting caliber O lineman instead of a bunch of backups and weaker guys like Ty who was picked in the 2nd round with a 4th to 6th round grade that will get ran over in a half second. Ty was rated lower bc he is to weak for the NFL right now and couldn't even hold up against tougher college division talent in the senior bowl. NFL talent will break him and hurt the team. Trade Brock for a starting LT while you have him to trade and have people thinking you actually think he is worth something and hope that acting like Brock is getting better will do enough to get a trade bc we all know how bad he is when facing starters in the season, it seemed like he got sacked or had a bad play every time except for the one Manning told him to throw to Green in garbage time so that Green would catch a TD. You pay Shelley Smith a backup 2.5 million a year and more than he was making who isn't a starter and tried to make him one. Traded a 4th rounder and pay over 1.5 million for the worst center in the league and didn't start last year and played a hand full of snaps bc of it.","created_time":"2015-07-24T00:22:35+0000","id":"10153537161406318_10153537780801318"},{"from":{"name":"Larry Johnson","id":"959285744094768"},"message":"This is a good, workable group.

He would help Peyton Manning tremendously and can carry this team on his back just as he carries the Georgia Bulldogs on his back. So then you have Manning and Chubbs both that can carry this team on their back. That is a recipe for success. He can keep our defense off the field and fresh. The best defense is a great offense. We could score, run the clock down, and have so many weapons with Chubbs added to the team. I think with Chubbs along with our new additions this year and a few free agent additions or the right draft picks on the O line we could go head to head with any team with Chubbs at RB to help our QB that is hard to bring down and draws 8 man boxes, which opens the passing lanes while preventing a fully committed pass rush bc Chubbs demands that elite respect to where you can't just ignore the run game. Manning has and still can take down teams on his own, but with no O line he deserves help taking down teams instead of him having to do it on his own. If Manning had help like these other guys and like their teams give them, Manning would win the Superbowl each year, which means the Broncos would win it each year. It's frustrating that Elway hasn't provided Manning the help he deserves, and has him playing with no O line. If Elway would provide the right players and an NFL quality O line the Superbowl would be won each year by the Broncos as long as Manning decides to play. I think it's weird that the O line isn't fixed and possibly worse especially since everybody knows that the O line has hurt our team and held us back each year. Hopefully the O line system will do its job and Manning, Kubiak, and the Broncos will win the Superbowl this year. I wish Elway would sign everybody that could help this team this year bc this is a special Superbowl to win. Hopefully the coaches do their job and the players will do their job and help Manning and the Broncos will win the Superbowl this year. Our other RB's would compliment Chubbs well too. RB Nick Chubbs would be the one addition over everybody else that could be added that would help this team. You got to score points now and Chubbs would definitely help in that area with Manning at QB! If Gurley stays healthy who runs just like Chubbs and who Chubbs took over for when Gurley got hurt, Gurley will run the Rams into the playoffs each year on his back. Chubbs is younger and more durable, and got better while doing just as good of job at RB for Georgia last year. In my opinion Chubbs will be the better RB and the best in the league, and Gurley will be a close behind him if he stays healthy. Plus they both can pass catch. An elite RB helps the team in all areas and on both sides of the ball. It isn't often these type of backs come along and especially in back to back years. We have to get Chubbs next year, especially since we missed out on the other Georgia RB Todd Gurley that can carry a team to the playoffs on his back this past year. A RB that scores points, opens the offense up, slows and stops pass rushers, and keeps the defense fresh is more important and does more for the team than any pass rusher no matter how many sacks a pass rusher gets, bc that elite bell cow RB can keep that pass rusher off the field or neutralize his pass rush.","created_time":"2015-07-22T09:28:07+0000","id":"10153533571871318_10153534513736318"},{"from":{"name":"Dejahn Atkins","id":"10203592697217653"},"message":"He's going to be a beast for us","created_time":"2015-07-21T23:50:02+0000","id":"10153533571871318_10153533624881318"},{"from":{"name":"Robert Woros","id":"1138368699511615"},"message":"Bronco Country has faith in you!

I'm betting he would be very productive and Manning trust him. Also should sign J. Gresham, P. Thomas,  Bradshaw, trade Brock for Andrew Whitworth at LT and Hillman and Shelley Smith for a starting guard. Trade Gino Gradkowski, Ball, and Tony Carter for a starting center. We would definitely have the team to beat and the best team to win the Superbowl if all of those signings and trades happened. Elway can't let this O line hinder thIs team a 4th year with it getting worse each year and causing the team to weaken each year. That's bad management to not improve the O line and to send any team out there with this O line that couldn't hold up to some SEC college schools and some college schools have better O lines than this so called patch work of an O line. It's pathetic and doesn't look good that Elway has failed this team each year with the O line and still hasn't fixed it. I can't believe TY is being called the LT when he couldn't hold up at the college senior bowl. That's why he was considered a reach in the second round and had a grade of 4th to the 6th round bc he is too weak to play right now. This will be a shame if this O line fails the team, fans, coaches, Manning, the run game, the defense by causing them to be drained with energy and confidence that they can't pull their own weight, and the whole organization again. It's on Elway to assemble it though. If you can't fix an O line in 4 years then you don't need to be a GM the 5th year Elway. So I hope it doesn't fail the team again bc that is Elway failing the team again. If the O line does what it should and is what we should have as an O line we can and probably will win the Superbowl. I would be fixing this O line and not leave it to chance that it can work before Elway goes down as one of the worst GM's in NFL history bc we clearly have a great chance at the Superbowl if the O line doesn't destroy the team again and hurt the teams confidence and momentum. Every other GM concentrates on the O line each year and the few that haven't, started doing so the past couple years and even the Panthers and TB started working on it this year with true starting caliber players. Everyone has figured out that backup quality O lineman really hurt the team in so many ways. It hurts the team even when you have Manning that makes you for the lack of O line and is the only QB that could and does play behind the one he has had to pay with. Manning deserves more and better especially now that he is getting older. He shouldn't have to play QB and the O line at the same time. He plays QB, the O line in pass protection, and even had to help them run block against the Chargers last year. That is a shame to send a professional team out there with what you're calling an O line. You should be embarrassed and ashamed that you can't put together a better O line than what you have patched together Elway. Stop worrying about 5 years from now when it won't matter anyway bc there will be no chance at a Superbowl after Manning retires, which I hope isn't for another 3 more years after this season.","created_time":"2015-07-18T23:57:00+0000","id":"10153522763366318_10153524669746318"},{"from":{"name":"Jeremiah Corum","id":"908110582587581"},"message":"How did the graphics department not realize the emoji is a right hand?","created_time":"2015-07-18T06:27:39+0000","id":"10153522763366318_10153522901091318"},{"from":{"name":"Oliver JesÃºs Espinosa","id":"10153169847079209"},"message":"yeah!!
