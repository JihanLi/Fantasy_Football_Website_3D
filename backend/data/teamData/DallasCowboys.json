Mr. Gregory must be weighing 275lbs to be an effective DE against quality NFL offensive linemen. He was drafted weighing at 235lbs. The article stated that he has gained 15lbs. That would put him at 250lbs playing the DE position. I do realize that Mr. Cliff Avril of the Seattle Seahawks does play the DE position weighing 260lbs but he is not an every down player. There are not a bunch of hybrid DE players in the NFL. In fact, wasn't Mr. Michael Samms unsuccessful making the Rams' and the Cowboys' rosters at that weight? I think that Mr. Gregory will be unsuccessful playing at the DE position unless he plays the linebacker position.","created_time":"2015-07-25T16:37:02+0000","id":"10154135237852814_10154139902327814"},{"from":{"name":"David Anthony Barbier","id":"10203581437371599"},"message":"From that picture Randy looks like he has put on the weight...Nice bro!!","created_time":"2015-07-23T19:45:03+0000","id":"10154135237852814_10154135413667814"},{"from":{"name":"Kevin Jackson","id":"1032349096777702"},"message":"Need somebody to get after the QB","created_time":"2015-07-23T20:58:35+0000","id":"10154135237852814_10154135547722814"},{"from":{"name":"Tarrence Flowers","id":"10207569417537772"},"message":"This time next year Gregory will be a beast","created_time":"2015-07-23T19:34:01+0000","id":"10154135237852814_10154135393862814"},{"from":{"name":"George Xiromamos","id":"10153578827227318"},"message":"2015 NFL Draft power rankings had the Cowboys at #3, behind the Vikes and Browns.

Lost half of season because people wanted Hogeboom in 84. 88 broke leg in early part of season. So really in the short time he played racked up 22,000 yards. Held almost every Cowboy record  for 20+ years. Broke almost all Staubachs records . Aikman didn't even break his records. White led them to 3 strait nfc championship games his first 3 years. Has that ever been done? I believe his first 4 years he was 48- 12. Danny didn't loose those games defence did. They let Eagles run up over 200 yards running. Same with redskins.

My name is Mr Perez\nMiguel, based at Canada. I want to notify the general public how I was helped by the Great Illuminati World rich in regaining back my business position after been sacked for about 4years and six months. I have been in pains and troubles ever since I was sacked from the company where I work called 'europe' Deposit Insurance corporation' as an agency executive. I have been hopeless, financially down through out these years. But one day, as I was browsing through the Internet, I came across the post of the Great Illuminati world rich saying you can be famous, rich and successful in life by been a member of the great Illuminati world rich, immediately I contacted and I explained everything to them and they recommended me and helped me by initiating me to the great illuminati world rich after providing some certain items and also they gave me all the guidelines and told me their place worship. With the help of the Great illuminati world rich I was able to go to temple and there I was initiated fully as a complete Illuminati member. Surprisingly 48 hours after i was initiated, i receive a call from the company that I have been accepted back again as the agency executive of the company at first I was shocked and surprised but later regain myself, I was told to resume work the next day by 6:00am. Starting from that day I and my family had been living a joyful and a luxurious life. So viewers who are interested in becoming a member of the Illuminati and also want to be famous, rich,wealthy and gain power should peacefully contact me from here and be seriously fast when it comes to In box me. Be a member of the the Great illuminati world rich and achieve all your desire and accomplish your dreams. Thanks to the\ngreat illuminati world of riches.","created_time":"2015-07-12T09:40:40+0000","id":"10154067264312814_10154107120592814"},{"from":{"name":"John Randle","id":"689511427850124"},"message":"PLEASE HELP!!! https://www.change.org/p/wake-bali-dolphins-free-four-wild-dolphins-contained-in-a-tiny-resort-pool","created_time":"2015-07-09T17:41:15+0000","id":"10154067264312814_10154099793967814"},{"from":{"name":"Joel De Jesus","id":"1457761894548087"},"message":"Check out the full video on youtube here‚§µ\nMira el video completo en youtube aqui‚û° http://goo.gl/oLrljR","created_time":"2015-07-09T16:38:01+0000","id":"10154067264312814_10154099692182814"},{"from":{"name":"Moncef Bouraoui","id":"945406568854727"},"message":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4m9Nr5vOE","created_time":"2015-07-09T17:47:17+0000","id":"10154067264312814_10154099808217814"},{"from":{"name":"Donald Gray","id":"1628959510685944"},"message":"Urgent, Must see this video on our blogsite from youtube at\r\n\n http://gdmpv14developmentteam.blogspot.com\r\n\nFree money from this program","created_time":"2015-07-09T16:53:15+0000","id":"10154067264312814_10154099721267814"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nw==","before":"MzE="}},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":31,"can_comment":true}}},{"name":"20 Questions: Which Performance From 2014 Will Be The Hardest To Match?","created_time":"2015-07-08T22:33:18+0000","shares":{"count":334},"link":"http://oak.ctx.ly/r/3b70v","id":"99559607813_10154098287897814","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Manuel Sosa","id":"918513784872113"},{"name":"Jonatan Hernandez","id":"713136162124478"},{"name":"Juan Hernandez","id":"1673339939566372"},{"name":"Cherrell Bryant","id":"10207210636967426"},{"name":"Jesse Griffin","id":"511887318969754"},{"name":"Forrest Swink","id":"1606738139598211"},{"name":"Carlos Daniel Aguilar","id":"1460373604264564"},{"name":"Kustom Phonez","id":"1639806659568873"},{"name":"Randal Conway","id":"1468032113518555"},{"name":"Alex Kraeft","id":"911208495607002"},{"name":"Jay Coleman","id":"511322375710833"},{"name":"Nick'nApril Angel","id":"1455907191379983"},{"name":"Dakoda Schoonover","id":"1609118686027993"},{"name":"Daphney Bourdeau","id":"870303053051694"},{"name":"Sheila Jennings","id":"516965765117755"},{"name":"David Everett Dauphney","id":"820105188104722"},{"name":"Caralampio Macfarland","id":"979976835395703"},{"name":"Pine Bartholomew","id":"487007401481063"},{"name":"Kacey Hernandez","id":"871325666292676"},{"name":"Vicky Johnson","id":"1471116523206022"},{"name":"Shavelle N Shawnasty Luning","id":"1636373253297235"},{"name":"Adolfo Javier Reyes","id":"462945573875218"},{"name":"Trinard Lee","id":"1476900162622479"},{"name":"Guillermo Garcia","id":"1643265259225222"},{"name":"Curtis Johnson","id":"1454373034887660"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1NDM3MzAzNDg4NzY2MA==","before":"OTE4NTEzNzg0ODcyMTEz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/99559607813_10154098287897814/likes?summary=true&fields=name&access_token=CAAXEZBZArg9yEBADdhnWDPpd9V6UZBNH1lbyUXAs4kZA4jppv8DUlTkNpuPdeSLBg2YZAILgVBRZA3NlPDnOtP0eEUiJL5Q69d934kVcpzKYNCiNlyZCENXzZBQ3yDT7rXTr4UnLRwRmCc4lS1DRl9IZBivpzTvO2yoZAhVRS0GLmFd7wfCQA8EiZCJtJ2iZAKvx1AlGXxmkjZCmqJGqquToGZC1YRHqSkYyp6ZAcEZD&limit=25&after=MTQ1NDM3MzAzNDg4NzY2MA%3D%3D"},"summary":{"total_count":8221,"can_like":true,"has_liked":false}},"comments":{"data":[{"from":{"name":"Luisa Vega-Garcia","id":"1625809894370843"},"message":"Its defense!

EVEN if he were still with the Cowboys he would be hard pressed to match last years numbers...Look at what Adrian Peterson did when he ran for over 2000 yards with less carries and a worse O-Line and only a few months removed from his knee injury. Folks were saying that he would break the record for sure the following year because he would be completely healthy. He wasn't even close. And of course last year he had legal problems. Now I know he didn't have a great O-Line but still it is very difficult to duplicate the performance he had when he almost broke Eric Dickersons record. I think the Cowboys will miss Demarco but they don't really have to have him. They just need consistency with what they got now.","created_time":"2015-07-10T00:37:15+0000","id":"10154098287897814_10154101026772814"},{"from":{"name":"Carol A.

My name is Mr Perez\nMiguel, based at Canada. I want to notify the general public how I was helped by the Great Illuminati World rich in regaining back my business position after been sacked for about 4years and six months. I have been in pains and troubles ever since I was sacked from the company where I work called 'europe' Deposit Insurance corporation' as an agency executive. I have been hopeless, financially down through out these years. But one day, as I was browsing through the Internet, I came across the post of the Great Illuminati world rich saying you can be famous, rich and successful in life by been a member of the great Illuminati world rich, immediately I contacted and I explained everything to them and they recommended me and helped me by initiating me to the great illuminati world rich after providing some certain items and also they gave me all the guidelines and told me their place worship. With the help of the Great illuminati world rich I was able to go to temple and there I was initiated fully as a complete Illuminati member. Surprisingly 48 hours after i was initiated, i receive a call from the company that I have been accepted back again as the agency executive of the company at first I was shocked and surprised but later regain myself, I was told to resume work the next day by 6:00am. Starting from that day I and my family had been living a joyful and a luxurious life. So viewers who are interested in becoming a member of the Illuminati and also want to be famous, rich,wealthy and gain power should peacefully contact me from here and be seriously fast when it comes to In box me. Be a member of the the Great illuminati world rich and achieve all your desire and accomplish your dreams. Thanks to the\ngreat illuminati world of riches.","created_time":"2015-07-12T09:41:34+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154107122062814"},{"from":{"name":"Nick Borowitz","id":"10101136632810640"},"message":"For those NYC Dallas Cowboys Fans!! \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/NYCDallasCowboys/","created_time":"2015-07-07T11:23:24+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154094047167814"},{"from":{"name":"Gloria Elizabeth","id":"1473000129685134"},"message":"Any single men should add me for serious relationship","created_time":"2015-07-07T11:08:09+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154094014402814"},{"from":{"name":"Richard Douglas","id":"133400693663879"},"message":"COWBOY UP !","created_time":"2015-07-06T15:16:10+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154090264302814"},{"from":{"name":"Bobby Young","id":"342206859303545"},"message":"I'am 68 have to pass no time","created_time":"2015-07-06T14:22:33+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154090182897814"},{"from":{"name":"Dawn Lambert","id":"693595587450552"},"message":"1 I don't have children 2 I don't live in Dallas but I really would love to meet the Dallas cowboys cheerleaders","created_time":"2015-07-06T14:20:34+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154090180402814"},{"from":{"name":"Manuel SDulege","id":"10153519575853130"},"message":"Deem..... there are Hot and lonely Man here mamitas","created_time":"2015-07-06T05:16:13+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154088580787814"},{"from":{"name":"Abdelkarim Gacem","id":"885477084868176"},"message":"http://dailylolworthypictures.me/11-images-that-prove-like-father-like-son?utm_campaign=ml&utm_medium=ml&utm_source=ml160&utm_term=3636166","created_time":"2015-07-06T01:36:26+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154087578777814"},{"from":{"name":"Tracy Paul","id":"128186674187171"},"message":"Hello......how are you doing today and i am here for an honest caring man that is ready for a serious relationship?","created_time":"2015-07-08T14:39:02+0000","id":"10154067240052814_10154097361707814"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nw==","before":"MjE="}},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":21,"can_comment":true}}},{"created_time":"2015-07-05T21:36:05+0000","shares":{"count":2404},"link":"https://www.facebook.com/DallasCowboys/photos/a.10152294327602814.1073741825.99559607813/10154086921992814/?type=1","id":"99559607813_10154086921992814","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Hanna Genagh","id":"128186657520506"},{"name":"Cindy Duarte","id":"1030829780275597"},{"name":"Robert Savage","id":"1613507852264960"},{"name":"Brandon Ramirez","id":"1032112563507678"},{"name":"Chase Walker","id":"1473236506324568"},{"name":"Symone Velez","id":"1208999795783565"},{"name":"Reece Parks","id":"10203481870086183"},{"name":"Rayford RayBoss Arthur","id":"10204602337208405"},{"name":"Wellington Castilho","id":"476205349220342"},{"name":"Jermal Simmons","id":"1092950714065706"},{"name":"Crystal R.

My name is Mr Perez\nMiguel, based at Canada. I want to notify the general public how I was helped by the Great Illuminati World rich in regaining back my business position after been sacked for about 4years and six months. I have been in pains and troubles ever since I was sacked from the company where I work called 'europe' Deposit Insurance corporation' as an agency executive. I have been hopeless, financially down through out these years. But one day, as I was browsing through the Internet, I came across the post of the Great Illuminati world rich saying you can be famous, rich and successful in life by been a member of the great Illuminati world rich, immediately I contacted and I explained everything to them and they recommended me and helped me by initiating me to the great illuminati world rich after providing some certain items and also they gave me all the guidelines and told me their place worship. With the help of the Great illuminati world rich I was able to go to temple and there I was initiated fully as a complete Illuminati member. Surprisingly 48 hours after i was initiated, i receive a call from the company that I have been accepted back again as the agency executive of the company at first I was shocked and surprised but later regain myself, I was told to resume work the next day by 6:00am. Starting from that day I and my family had been living a joyful and a luxurious life. So viewers who are interested in becoming a member of the Illuminati and also want to be famous, rich,wealthy and gain power should peacefully contact me from here and be seriously fast when it comes to In box me. Be a member of the the Great illuminati world rich and achieve all your desire and accomplish your dreams. Thanks to the\ngreat illuminati world of riches.","created_time":"2015-07-12T09:42:45+0000","id":"10154067255662814_10154107122862814"},{"from":{"name":"Hassam Jawaid","id":"10206746776335472"},"message":"Zach","created_time":"2015-07-05T16:27:06+0000","id":"10154067255662814_10154085809187814"},{"from":{"name":"Jesse Gonzalez","id":"10206460806552382"},"message":"Erin Hanks","created_time":"2015-07-03T22:43:25+0000","id":"10154067255662814_10154078441887814"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NA==","before":"MjE="}},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":22,"can_comment":true}}},{"created_time":"2015-07-02T17:05:42+0000","shares":{"count":200},"link":"https://www.facebook.com/DallasCowboys/photos/a.415071317813.208337.99559607813/10154069317122814/?type=1","id":"99559607813_10154069317122814","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Richard Mcvoy","id":"937028076343202"},{"name":"Andres Lopez","id":"1704956526391924"},{"name":"Cindy Duarte","id":"1030829780275597"},{"name":"Brandon Ramirez","id":"1032112563507678"},{"name":"Wellington Castilho","id":"476205349220342"},{"name":"Britnie Grigg","id":"1460760007581247"},{"name":"Crystal R.

Since its introduction in June 2012, It has achieved rapidly growing sales. It scored a Perfect 5.0(Highest Available) NHTSA Automobile Safety Rating. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Official Range for the Model S Performance model is 265 miles (426 km). \nIf you didn't know, Electric Motors can provide \"Instant Acceleration\", which means these Cars take off like  Rockets!!! The Model S - 85 kWh Signature's Top Speed is 125 MPH (201 km/h) and it Accelerates from 0 to 60 MPH(0 to 97 km/h) in 5.4 seconds. The Signature Performance Model's Top Speed is 130 MPH (210 km/h) and Accelerates from 0‚Äì60 MPH in 4.2 seconds, while the 60 kWh Base Model's Top Speed is 120 MPH (190 km/h), and it Accelerates from 60 MPH in 5.9 seconds. The Powertrain also provides \"Regenerative Braking Power\" of up to more than 60 kW, which Reduces both Energy Consumption and Wear on the Brakes.\nNo Loud Engine Noise! No Smoke, No Pollution! And everyday, more \"Superchargers\" are being made to run on Clean-Solar Energy instead of Utility Grid Power. Tesla built 120 kW \"Supercharger\" Stations all over America  to Allow Travel between key US cities, and more are being built every day. A Supercharger can add up to 200 miles (320 km) of range in 20 minutes. Plug your Tesla in at home for Overnight Charging, every day you'll wake up with a Full Battery. You can Charge your Tesla Almost Anywhere that you find a Power Outlet.\nThere is Tons of Storage space in a Tesla!! If you didn't know, Electric Motors are about the size of a Watermelon, so you can imagine all the free space this provides. The Model S has a Front Trunk where the engine would be in a typical car, Frunk Space!!The Rear Trunk is also Very Large, because there is no need for an Exhaust System or Big Gas Tank.\nThe Instrument Panel is a 12.3-inch (31 cm)  Touchscreen Computer.  A top line displays status symbols and provides shortcuts to Charging, HomeLink, Driver Profiles, Vehicle Information, and Bluetooth. The second line provides access to several apps including Media, Nav, Energy, Web, Camera and Phone. The central main viewing area displays the (two) Active Apps, subdivided into upper and lower areas. At the bottom is access to Various Controls and Settings for the vehicle such as Doors, Locks and Lights as well as Temperature Controls and a Secondary Volume Control. The Navigation System uses GPS and a mix of Garmin and Google Maps Route Guidance. The Map Display on the 17-inch Screen requires a constant Internet Connection, so Navigation is Limited in Areas Without Mobile Network Coverage. The Nav on the Instrument Panel is loaded on the car and does not need Internet access to function. Update 6.2 features Automatic Nav Guidance to Charging Stations if range is insufficient.\nAll new Model S's come equipped with a Camera mounted at the top of the Windshield, Forward Looking Radar in the lower Grill, and Ultrasonic Acoustic Location Sensors in the front and rear Bumpers that provide a 360-degree Buffer Zone around the car. This Equipment allows Model S to Detect Road Signs, Lane Markings, Obstacles, and Other Vehicles. In addition to Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Departure Warning, a US$4,250 \"Tech Package\" option will allow this system to enable Semi-Autonomous Drive and Parking Capabilities. New models have the option to have AutoPilot, which allows Hands-Free Driving in many situations. AutoPilot-enabled cars receive Software Updates for the AutoPilot Software Wirelessly, just as all other Model S cars receive General Software Updates Wirelessly.\nAvailable in (Dual-Motor) All Wheel Drive, which Improves Range and Top Speed.","created_time":"2015-06-24T15:25:04+0000","id":"10154012109522814_10154039685242814"},{"from":{"name":"Hope Nathaniel","id":"158882054442731"},"message":"Am a widowed woman looking for a responsible man to be my soulmate,you can text me on (2)(0)(2)(6)(9)(7)(6)(5)(3)(3) for a better conversation","created_time":"2015-06-24T19:42:32+0000","id":"10154012109522814_10154040593702814"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NA==","before":"MTQ="}},"summary":{"order":"ranked","total_count":14,"can_comment":true}}},{"name":"Rookie Watch: WR Farmer Looks To Follow Father‚Äôs Route To The NFL","created_time":"2015-06-23T15:52:08+0000","shares":{"count":368},"link":"http://oak.ctx.ly/r/382rf","id":"99559607813_10154034725927814","likes":{"data":[{"name":"Camrin Haynes","id":"1476544315989701"},{"name":"Susan Newland","id":"1631048607179176"},{"name":"Michael N Michelle Gonzales","id":"1432192730443760"},{"name":"Marjorie Choice","id":"120479208294829"},{"name":"Randy Indoe","id":"1621822034737972"},{"name":"Scooby Defour","id":"10205026739203667"},{"name":"Elhassann Diabiaraa","id":"1610607439190284"},{"name":"Crystal R.
