Of course Manning is going to be rated better look at his statistics in all of his years. Peyton is a smart and threatening player. And yes we had no running game the past like million seasons lol which now maybe our running game will be stronger, not putting so much pressure on the passing game, allowing Luck to take a little bit off of his shoulders and focus a little better so he doesn't feel like his arm needs to carry the team to the win like the past two seasons.
