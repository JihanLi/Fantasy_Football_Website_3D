He would help Matt Ryan tremendously and can carry this team on his back just as he carries the Georgia Bulldogs on his back. He can keep our defense off the field and fresh. The best defense is a great offense. We could score, run the clock down, and have so many weapons with Chubbs added to the team. I think with Chubbs along with our new additions this year and a few free agent additions we could go head to head with almost any team and possibly every team with Chubbs at RB to help our QB that is hard to bring down and draws 8 man boxes, which opens the passing lanes while preventing a fully committed pass rush bc Chubbs demands that elite respect to where you can't just ignore the run game. Our other RB's would compliment him well too. RB Nick Chubbs would be the one addition over everybody else that would help this team. You got to score points now! If Gurley stays healthy who runs just like Chubbs and who Chubbs took over for when Gurley got hurt, Gurley will run the Rams into the playoffs each year on his back. Chubbs is younger and more durable, and got better while doing just as good of job at RB for Georgia last year. In my opinion Chubbs will be the better RB and the best in the league, and Gurley will be a close behind him if he stays healthy. Plus they both can pass catch. An elite RB helps the team in all areas and on both sides of the ball. It isn't often these type of backs come along and especially in back to back years. We have to get Chubbs next year, especially since we missed out on the other home grown RB that can carry a team to the playoffs on his back this past year. A RB that scores points, opens the offense up, slows and stops pass rushers, and keeps the defense fresh is more important and does more for the team than any pass rusher no matter how many sacks.","created_time":"2015-07-22T09:10:55+0000","id":"10153123571827842_10153126987842842"},{"from":{"name":"Christopher Parrish","id":"787349128052006"},"message":"Now Suckas are in trouble, I can finally can sack a QB!!!

TRU and Alford are solid, we'll see how Collins does, but after that the talent levels aren't the same.  And Southward was being switched from fs to cb.  Not a guarantee.  O line is the next worry, but the only worry I have about it is tackle depth.

I was the only fan allowed to break the rules. Why? I was motivating the franchise for free. In 2006 on April the 12th QB Michael Vick gave me the nickname STATS. I went to the Atlanta Falcons training camp from 2006 to 2010, as a fan. HARDCORE FACTS. In 2006, Michael Vick was the first quarterback to rush for over a 1000 yards in a single season. They finished the season 8-8, winning 6 of the first eight games. In 2007, WR Roddy White, had 83 receptions for 1202 yards 14.5 yards a reception and 6 touchdowns. In 2008, Roddy White had his first Pro Bowl appearance. In 2009, the Atlanta Falcons had the very first back-to-back winning seasons. In 2009, the Atlanta Falcons wore throwback uniforms for the first time in seven seasons. In 2010 Roddy White was the number one wide receiver in the NFL. From 2008 to 2010, HC Mike Smith's Atlanta Falcons were W 33 and L 15. I did not go to training camp 2011 - 2014, as a fan. From 2011 - 2014, with WR Julio Jones, Mike Smith Atlanta Falcons W 33 and L 31. I MOTIVATED THE Atlanta Falcons, as a fan, FROM 2006 to 2010. I MOTIVATED RODDY WHITE. His stats have gone down consistently since 2011. I have a God given talent to motivate athletes. The last time that motivated the team, November 30th 2014 vs the Arizona Cardinals. Arizona was 9 wins and 2 losses, the best record in the NFL. The Atlanta Falcons, 4 wins and 7 losses. RB Steven Jackson had his first and only 100 yard rushing game, and it was the only win the Atlanta Falcons had in 2014, beating a team with a winning record. It was 17 to 0 at the end of the first quarter, Atlanta Falcons. So if you are excited about the Atlanta Falcons, just know the Atlanta Falcons Motivator has not been hired yet. I, Michael STATS Wallin, AM THE ATLANTA FALCONS MOTIVATOR.
