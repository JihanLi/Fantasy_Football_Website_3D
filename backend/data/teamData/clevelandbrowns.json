They are one dimensional on offense. The defense still has holes against the run. Adding one player to the line doesn't fix the worst run defense in the league. It helps, but it doesn't all of a sudden go from worst against the run to even top 10. This team had the fewest number of touchdowns for a receiving unit last year. They replaced that unit with guys who combined to score LESS touchdowns than that group. The quarterback situation is such a mess that the third-string guy is the best long-term candidate to start. McCown is garbage. He had one good half of a season in his career. Manziel is an idiot. Run all you want. You still have to pass on 50 percent of downs. And smart defensive coordinators will stack the box and force the pass while pressuring the quarterback forcing lots of sacks and turnovers. The line is good, but five guys can't block seven, which means two will run free to the QB. How do you spin that into a legitimate playoff contender? Oh, and don't forget the schedule is more difficult than last year's. Even if the Browns are no worse in ability, which I would argue it is worse, the record goes from 7-9 to 5-11. Last I checked, five wins doesn't get you in playoff contention.","created_time":"2015-07-24T21:58:24+0000","id":"10153552389444684_10153552794954684"},{"from":{"name":"Martino Harmon","id":"10101699325540092"},"message":"Yes they \"JUST NEED a QB and receivers\" I love the Browns but \"Child Please!\" WTF!

I just finished up graduating from Troy University and getting my degree in Sport and Fitness Management in December while also finishing my collegiate career as a 3 year starter in which I played defensive back and contributed my whole playing career on special teams as a gunner, return man, etc. I was blessed to finish 5th in the Sun-Belt Conference in pass break-ups in the 2103 football season. I also was voted onto the 2014 pre-season All-Conference Football Team. I am coming out with this years 2015 draft class. Attached with this message is my college highlight. I believe that while viewing my highlight you will see some gifts that God has blessed me to have such as speed, covering skills, big hit ability, and special teams play. I also have attached my game film against Ole Miss in which I was matched up the whole game against their star receiver Donte Moncreif who is now a star receiver for the Indianapolis Colts. By God's grace and empowerment I helped my team hold him to 3 catches for 39 yards and no touchdowns. My 40 time is between a 4.4-4.6. My best broad jump was is a 10'3 in which I jumped at my pro day. I was blessed to rep out the 225 bench 22 times at my pro day. My best 5-10-5 shuttle time is a 3.84. Also, my best L drill shuttle is a 6.8. God has definitely blessed me to put up these numbers. I appreciate you for taking the time to view my email and I sincerely hope that you take the time to view my highlight and game film against Ole Miss. If you want me to send any other game film please let me know. Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.

McCown may not be Rogers, Brady, or Manning but he is on Dilfer's level. I am a Browns fan that lives in Chicago and I watched every start for McCown and he ran the Bears offense better than Cutler. When McCown has talent around him and in the right system he will produce. There is a reason the Bears tried signing McCown in the offseason. Tampa Bay's defense was horrible, the offensive line was horrible, and they had no running game. McCown is playing behind arguably the best offensive line in football behind Thomas, Mack, and Bitonio and will be supported by a strong running game with Johnson, Crowell, and West. The Browns defense will finish top 3 in the NFL. The Browns already had the best secondary and a strong group of LBs. Beefing up the defensive line with Starks, Shelton, and Cooper just fixed the only weak spot on the defense. I can't wait to see how many more turnovers the Browns secondary forces being supported by a dominant front 7. The Browns may not win a Super Bowl next season but they are a lot better than what most people think.
