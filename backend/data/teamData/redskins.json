Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked. The action takes place on the playing surface, not the locker room. Get the bloody media voyeurs out of the locker room.","created_time":"2015-07-28T14:31:03+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153645079779574"},{"from":{"name":"Louis Buggy-Bugg Robinson","id":"10200621481375618"},"message":"And u know he is. ..hard hitting Robinson","created_time":"2015-07-28T15:14:15+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153645162419574"},{"from":{"name":"Tommy Miller","id":"671047099697638"},"message":"#HTTR","created_time":"2015-07-28T17:02:07+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153645428269574"},{"from":{"name":"Bruce Ellis","id":"1676171902603004"},"message":"die hard fan","created_time":"2015-07-28T14:39:43+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153645095389574"},{"from":{"name":"Haywood Herring","id":"1674785279420095"},"message":"Just do it","created_time":"2015-07-28T21:50:24+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153646024669574"},{"from":{"name":"Leon Giles","id":"130708837268164"},"message":"Im ready for football","created_time":"2015-07-28T19:58:01+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153645778444574"},{"from":{"name":"Brian Baytops","id":"10153538902921661"},"message":"Up and coming star..go kill this year., IF he stays healthy","created_time":"2015-07-29T03:03:44+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153646508629574"},{"from":{"name":"Maggie Platte","id":"10153142899497023"},"message":"Love the Redskins!!","created_time":"2015-07-28T20:58:19+0000","id":"10153645017664574_10153645909544574"},{"from":{"name":"Derek McCoy","id":"1037363186274320"},"message":"He's getting better every year....

The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's an offensive freaking naked beefcake show courtesy by management and media. It's exploitation and objectification of naked young male athletes. Management makes it an obligatory condition in their contracts. Here‚Äôs an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man up‚Äù by management and media. It‚Äôs the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sandusky‚Äôs and Graham James‚Äôs of this world. That‚Äôs the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked.

The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's an offensive freaking naked beefcake show courtesy by management and media. It's exploitation and objectification of naked young male athletes. Management makes it an obligatory condition in their contracts. Here‚Äôs an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man up‚Äù by management and media. It‚Äôs the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sandusky‚Äôs and Graham James‚Äôs of this world. That‚Äôs the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked. The action takes place on the playing surface, not the locker room. Get the bloody media voyeurs out of the locker room.","created_time":"2015-07-26T22:57:13+0000","id":"10153638719059574_10153641057274574"},{"from":{"name":"Anthony Webb","id":"1597960273804354"},"message":"Jones","created_time":"2015-07-26T21:11:03+0000","id":"10153638719059574_10153640879424574"},{"from":{"name":"Josh Chambers","id":"10207541309037739"},"message":"Just win.","created_time":"2015-07-27T04:33:30+0000","id":"10153638719059574_10153641556514574"},{"from":{"name":"Alfred Warren","id":"1734609646766566"},"message":"Morris n Redd 4 sure.","created_time":"2015-07-29T08:11:17+0000","id":"10153638719059574_10153646762609574"},{"from":{"name":"Myke Kella Charley","id":"10200758643245281"},"message":"https://m.facebook.com/groups/1504077119864979?tsid=0.1842815806157887&source=typeahead","created_time":"2015-07-27T01:03:58+0000","id":"10153638719059574_10153641219914574"},{"from":{"name":"Ryan Flood","id":"10207382006847432"},"message":"Jones is gonna be a beast.

In comparison, think of the marriages that fail when one partner tries to make the other into what they want instead of accepting the person for what attracted you to them in the first place.  Successes are the result of playing to one's strengths and not trying to force someone into something they are not.

The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's an offensive freaking naked beefcake show courtesy by management and media. It's exploitation and objectification of naked young male athletes. Management makes it an obligatory condition in their contracts. Here‚Äôs an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man up‚Äù by management and media. It‚Äôs the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sandusky‚Äôs and Graham James‚Äôs of this world. That‚Äôs the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked. The action takes place on the playing surface, not the locker room.

The locker room is now a vulgar side show. There are hundreds of men and women, camera crews, sound people and now, bloggers. It's an offensive freaking naked beefcake show courtesy by management and media. It's exploitation and objectification of naked young male athletes. Management makes it an obligatory condition in their contracts. Here‚Äôs an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=whitlock/050811\nThere have been many athletes who have spoken out, only to be fined, disciplined, shamed, ridiculed, vilified and told to \"man up‚Äù by management and media. It‚Äôs the same stoic, shut up and man up garbage that predisposes the young victims of the Jerry Sandusky‚Äôs and Graham James‚Äôs of this world. That‚Äôs the message organized male pro-sport is sending to young men and boys. It tells them that men have no rights to boundaries. Then we wonder why some of them grow up not to respect the boundaries of others? So now the athletes have resigned themselves to it. We would never do this to women. If you don't believe me look at the different policies between the NBA and the WNBA. Male reporters are never allowed in when the women are naked. The action takes place on the playing surface, not the locker room. Get the bloody media voyeurs out of the locker room.","created_time":"2015-07-24T17:42:59+0000","id":"10153636114489574_10153636212929574"},{"from":{"name":"Austin Deez","id":"10153502026824487"},"message":"London Fletcher.

Let's keep in mind the talent he was supplied for his unit came at the hands of one Matt Millen.  The book has yet to be written on how he does in his first year here, but he will have way more talent than he probably did any year he was up Detroit.  Offensively the additions that were most important other than Scherff were assistants.  Offensive line coach and quarterback coach of Callahan's and Cavanaugh's experience has been needed since at least 2010.  We've had six quarterbacks who started in at least one game that were subpar in that time.  The one who was the most successful is still our starter; this season he'll have the most help from the coaching staff than he's had since he came into the league.  He has a position coach, a real one of which we probably haven't had since the 80s, who has 35+ years experience in the league as player and coach as a QB and a line coach who should teach those dudes how to protect, as well as open holes for 46; who should be the man as long as he's durable and doing what he's been doing since he came into the league.  Dude doesn't get hurt, except for the game in Oakland.  Last year a new head coach was hired; but this was the offseason where we've made the most needed changes, front office, coaches, and players, probably since the 90s.  Nothing that happened on the field last year should have any bearing on this year.  Won't even matter.  This is a new era; and we'll see at kickoff how much improvement we've made.......","created_time":"2015-07-18T21:26:07+0000","id":"10153619778309574_10153619938259574"},{"from":{"name":"Kati Gonzalez","id":"869656929756555"},"message":"Ugh.

The people who brought the talent in in years past did not have the focus of this GM.  He is building a team identity; which we haven't had since Joe II.    Not just players, but assistants too.  Notice the assistants were hired after Scot.  Too many changes have been made this offseason to relate last year to what may happen this season.  A new philosophy brought in by two offensive assistants should correct the ineffective play behind center and the ineptitude of our pass blocking.  New assistants and talent on defense should make that unit better.  We might not make the playoffs, or even be .500; but the team has finally added pieces needed for years.  We don't have to worry about coaches making final personnel decisions, or incompetent front office people who have no clue about finding players (or coaches for that matter.  Gruden isn't even Scot's guy; he's gone after a bad season.  Not because he's terrible, but because he's not a coach Scot would've hired).  Other than that, a lot of players we had last year will be different players this year; just by coaching; much of which we didn't have last year....","created_time":"2015-07-18T23:22:02+0000","id":"10153619778309574_10153620170364574"},{"from":{"name":"Bryan Cardenas","id":"10200803258721681"},"message":"Off-season counts..NOT AS MUCH AS THE SEASON!!!!

I was excited when we drafted RG3, I really was.  He is mentally on permanent IR, since he was injured in the Baltimore Game.  If you looked at him in the Philly game two weeks later, he wasn't the same, and he was extremely inaccurate against Dallas in Week 17.  The playoff game did start out well, 14-0, then he twerked his knee again and wasn't the same.  Since 2012, the Redskins have gone 7-25.  Kirk Cousins was given a shot at starting at the end of 2013 and went 0-3.  It wasn't a fair shot though, half the team had already checked out of the season mentally and Shanahan was already out the door.  So when Robert went down in Week 2 of 2014 and Kirk stepped in, he shredded the Jacksonville defense.  Granted, it was the Jacksonville defense.  The next week, he did the same thing against a fairly good Philly defense.  Only 1 interception that game.  Did they win it, no they didn't, but Kirk proved he can throw.  4 days later, he threw 4 interceptions against the Giants.  And preceded to go down since then.  Except for the Seattle game.  The same seattle seahawks who won the super bowl the year prior and had the famous Legion of Boom.  He didn't turn the ball over in that game.  Only reason they couldn't get a win that game, was because they kept getting pinned behind their own 10 yard line and the playcalling was terrible as well as a bad O-Line.  Robert is the starter going into training camp.  I think that Gruden should alternate the starters though.  Let Kirk or Colt start game 1 or 2, and still let Robert play in those games, let Robert start in Game 3 the dress rehearsal.  Then make a decision before game 4 of the preseason to who really should be the starter.","created_time":"2015-07-18T08:57:05+0000","id":"10153616708794574_10153618599009574"},{"from":{"name":"Roger Bordine","id":"10100632873538548"},"message":"# 6 at what?
