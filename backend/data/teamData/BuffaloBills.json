God said, liars, thieves, adulterers, will go to hell (Lake of Fire). Does that concern you at all? But Jesus bore the sins of those who CONFESS and REPENT (turn from all the sins that you love), and trust in Him as your Lord and Savior, then you will be saved. Just as you would trust in a parachute to save you from the law of gravity if you had to jump from a plane. You wouldn’t  just believe that the parachute would save you and jump without it. You’d put the parachute (Jesus) on and read the directions (Bible) to make sure it’s on correctly. So when you jump from the plane (Die).

This upcoming year, the Bills and Rex Ryan have brought in and filled all of the coaching positions (the exception being Donnie Henderson and some of the assistant staff) with former Jets coaches. Now, with that in mind, how do they exactly plan on being better than the system of the previous year when you are utilizing coaches that, though performed well, did not exceed last year's rankings?\n\nJets rankings under our new coaches (Dennis Thurman-DC, Bobby April III-LB, Karl Dunbar-DL and Tim McDonald-DB), for 2014:\n\nTotal yds: 6th - 5235\nYds/gm: 6th - 327.2\nPass yds total: 14th - 3746\n/gm: 14th - 234.1\n\nRush yds total (the only aspect that beat the Bills for 2014): 5th - 1489\n/gm: 5th - 93.1\nThis we'll compare to the Bills stats, as these are less advertised...\nTotal rush yds: 11th - 1703\n/gm: 11th 106.4\n\nLastly, where it matters, points allowed.\nJets total: 24th - 401\n/gm: 24th - 25.1\nBills total: 4th - 289\n/gm: 18.1\n\nObviously none of the matters if the offense cannot do its job. My point though, is quit shoveling this nonsense of wanting to be better. That's an absolute given, or at least it should be with how much these players are paid. As far as I am concerned, I feel that they should have left well enough alone with Jim Schwartz as the DC and his line/LB staff. They did outstanding last year. I fully support a shake up with DB coaching as it was the big plays that burned the team last year, but the D-line was an absolute beast as were our linebackers. \n\nI am excited for the season regardless, but I feel that the coaching staff was edited in the wrong places and true issues weren't completely addressed, such as the O-line. Now if we were to go and make an offer to Evan Mathis, that would be extraordinary, but it's the Bills, they won't and we will see another mediocre season come and go with people wondering why our defense was worse than it was last year....","created_time":"2015-07-23T04:49:49+0000","id":"10153346165760659_10153349587130659"},{"from":{"name":"Michael Hayes","id":"900689009991387"},"message":"If it wasnt for the defense the bills wouldn't have a team","created_time":"2015-07-21T22:27:14+0000","id":"10153346165760659_10153346834715659"},{"from":{"name":"Roger Muth","id":"822352344550949"},"message":"And still didn't make playoffs","created_time":"2015-07-22T00:22:07+0000","id":"10153346165760659_10153347007245659"},{"from":{"name":"Cliff Collenberg","id":"969825853070185"},"message":"And the Oakland Raiders beat them last year....doesn't say much...defense won't win games...and the new coach wants to run the ball over & over...look at what that got him in New York...need a specific \"name\" quarterback...facts are facts...","created_time":"2015-07-21T23:23:56+0000","id":"10153346165760659_10153346926920659"},{"from":{"name":"Michelle Morlock","id":"973325862687437"},"message":"Ya baby.

BUT, if we can legitimately win eight games {I do not count our week 17 \"win\" over the Brady-less for the 2nd half, and Gronk-less Deflatriots game as a legitimate win} with two High School coaches {}HC and OC}, a QB we pulled off the couch straight out of retirement that CLEARLY was ONLY on the fiel;d for the paycheck, a severely regressed O-Line, and pretty much NO running game, then I think we seriously do have a legitimate chance to win two more games this year, which would have us ending the season at 10-6, quite possibly enough wins to break this horrid playoff drought. Think about it ; we'll have twice as much production {maybe even more pending on the O-Line} from the run game, whichever QB does step up to the plate will do as good, but probably better than Kyle \"slide for no gain when I need two yards for the crucial first down\" Orton, a TE that can produce more/better than Scott Chandler on Chandler's best day and his worst, a better O-Line with a true, documented \"bully\", and former Pro Bowler whom Rex and Whaley {and the Pegulas} gave his FINAL chance to play the game he loves whom has a huge chip on his shoulder with something to prove, along with a promising rookie at the opposite G position, Glenn is in a contract year as well and will play like it too, a dynamic ST/KO/Punt return man whom also might be getting his last shot at redemption and playing the game he loves as well and a bonafide THREAT to go the distance every time he touches the ball, all while also retaining the entire fourth ranked overall defense {minus the part time S Searcy}.

We were at the airport by 4:00 AM and returned that night about 10:00 PM. Throughout the day, they assisted the veterans in any way they could and made certain the day was about the Vets - not themselves. They were also there to honor Ralph Wilson - a former veteran who donated $25,000. To the Buffalo Honor Flight. This trip is absolutely free to the veterans and they are treated like the heroes they are. If you know of a WWll Vet, there will be another trip in October. You can find the information online. It truly is a trip of a lifetime and one that my dad and I will remember always. Thank you, to the Wylie sisters and Buffalo Honor Flight for making this possible.
