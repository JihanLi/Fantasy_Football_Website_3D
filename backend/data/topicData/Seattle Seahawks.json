So, as one who has personally experienced this, there is A LOT of pressure on the new boyfriend when you have a baby already.  To be conscious of your relationship, your child, and the boyfriend, it is KEY to ease the child into the relationship.  Just like there is no time on love, there's no time limit to introduce your child.  Children are innocent, and speaking from experience, it is hard to tell your child not to express their love, or for them to curb it.  We have no clue how long Russell and Ciara have been dating... We have no clue when they brought little Future around eachother.  We do know, Russell Wilson is not a bad man, who pray he's no pedo, and we heard him publicly proclaim that he wants to lead this Woman in a Godly fashion.  That means, lead her and little future as she is his mother.  All of this judgement on all of them shows how dumbed down our society has become.  WHO CARES??? Future publicly announced that he had to give his fans The \"Dirty Sprite Future\" so because he made that choice, why can't another man be a role model in Little Future's Life?  I just do not understand.  Ciara don't be petty and Future get ya big guy boxers on and take this one on the chin, man.  For the betterment of Little Future, that is all.
