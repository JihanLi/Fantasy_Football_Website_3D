The Buffalo Bills have suspended offensive line coach Aaron Kromer without pay for the first six games of the upcoming season.\n\n\"The suspension will begin on Monday, September 7, 2015 and end with the conclusion of the Buffalo Bills vs. Cincinnati Bengals game on October 18, 2015,\" Bills president Russ Brandon said in a statement Sunday night. \"We worked in conjunction with the NFL on this matter and we are highly supportive of the NFL Personal Conduct Policy that holds all NFL club employees to a higher standard.\"\n\nKromer was with the Bills in training camp practice Monday. He had been on indefinite paid administrative leave as Buffalo began training camp Friday morning.\n\nHe will leave the team again at the start of the regular season and will be eligible to return to work for the Bills' Week 7 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars that will be played in London.\n\n2. After nearly two years away from football, Richie Incognito is expected to start at left guard for the Buffalo Bills this season, coach Rex Ryan said Sunday.\n\n\"One thing for sure is Richie's a starter,\" Ryan said. \"I mean, he looks about as good as any of them. He really does.\"\n\nIncognito was \"20 or 30 yards ahead of everybody else\" in the Bills' conditioning test last Thursday, Ryan said, and is in better shape than even the head coach expected.\n\n\"I've been blown away by it,\" Ryan said.\n\nand finally  The Buffalo Bills' shaky quarterback play in practices this spring and summer reached a new low Saturday when Matt Cassel and EJ Manuel went a combined 1-for-8 in a period of 11-on-11 work in practice.\n\nCassel and Manuel split reps with the first-team group in the Bills' \"two-spot\" drill Saturday after Cassel and Tyrod Taylor split time with that group Friday. If the pattern holds, Taylor and Manuel will be the first-team pairing Sunday.\n\nHere is the sequence of plays during the first 11-on-11 set of Saturday's practice:\n\nCassel:\n\nFirst down: Wobbled throw to Sammy Watkins down left sideline; Watkins came back to ball but pass was broken up by cornerback Ronald Darby in the end zone.\n\nSecond down: Run by LeSean McCoy.\n\nFirst down: Overthrown to Percy Harvin on out-breaking route.\n\nSecond down: Completed dump-off to tight end Matthew Mulligan.\n\nFirst down: Run by McCoy.\n\nManuel:\n\nSecond down: Overthrown to Harvin down right sideline.\n\nFirst down: Rollout and short pass to Harvin; pass broken up by cornerback Nickell Robey.\n\nSecond down: Pass thrown behind Sammy Watkins on drag route.\n\nFirst down: Overthrown to Chris Hogan deep down the middle.\n\nSecond down: Underthrown to Marquise Goodwin down left sideline; near interception by the cornerback in coverage.\n\nThe results improved slightly in the second 11-on-11 period, which featured more shorter passes, including some screen passes. Taylor went 3-for-4 in that period, although he avoided a would-be sack by Kyle Williams for one completion. Cassel also completed 3 of 4 passes in that set, including an impressive catch by Robert Woods over cornerback Ross Cockrell.\n\nAs expected, Taylor has shown a greater willingness to scramble out of the pocket -- and also to tuck the ball and run -- than the other two quarterbacks. With no contact allowed by defenders against the quarterback, it has been difficult to gauge whether he would be able to get off throws in live action that he can attempt in practice.\n\nCassel and Manuel have been plagued by inaccuracy, even on unguarded routes and 1-on-1 drills between receivers and cornerbacks. While they've been assisted by the athleticism and ball skills of Sammy Watkins and Woods, the quarterbacks have also been hurt by several drops by Hogan, Goodwin and Marcus Easley over the first two days of training camp.\n\nThere is no indication that the Bills are close to narrowing the group competing for the starting job to two quarterbacks, nor has there been any clear separation by any of the three quarterbacks over one another to this point.

I have accepted this request and will start at MSD mid-August.    Meanwhile Maraskeshia Smith, presently Deputy Director of DPS will become Interim Director at DPS.  \n \nThe journey we have been on together has been nothing short of exhilarating.  Within a short 16 months, together we have:\n‚Ä¢       Restructured the staffing model\n‚Ä¢       Increased our work on potholes from 31,000 to 49,000 AND completed most of them within ONE day, instead of 14 days previously.\n‚Ä¢       Shrank our bulk items pickup from within 17 days to within 6 days.\n‚Ä¢       Re-engineered our waste collection from 5 to 4 days, allowing very successful Neighborhood Cleanup Blitzes that have removed over 300 tons of trash from our communities.\n‚Ä¢       Collected dead animals within 1.28 days instead of 17 days previously.\n‚Ä¢       We now have about 99% of Performance Evaluations current, instead of 35% when we started.\n‚Ä¢       Changed the Cincinnati Municipal Code for trash pickup.\n‚Ä¢       Changed the Cincinnati Municipal Code for Litter and Weeds.\n‚Ä¢       Engaged into an innovative new Private Lot Abatement (PLA) program.\n‚Ä¢       Absorbed the great folks of Weed and Trash Code Enforcement from the Health Department.\n‚Ä¢       Created a comprehensive Greenspace Maintenance Master Plan. \n‚Ä¢       Created a new mapping of the city‚Äôs streets to better serve residents during winter storms.\n‚Ä¢       Responded on Winter Slippery Streets within 1 day, instead of three days.\n‚Ä¢       Created a citizens-based Advisory Council meeting every two month to give us guidance and feedback.\n‚Ä¢       Extended our community outreach through FaceBook with over 230,000 views and close to 2,000 ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù engaged (compared to about 100 engaged and less than 400 views)\n‚Ä¢       Created an internationally-viral social media event thanks to Mark and Eddie, demonstrating to the world (with millions of views) that the City of Cincinnati and DPS are very cool!\n‚Ä¢       Created a fleet modernization plan which led to a Capital Acceleration Program.\n‚Ä¢       Conducted a comprehensive illegal dumping study.\n‚Ä¢       Initiated the creation of a citation APP that will optimize our Code Enforcement work.\n‚Ä¢       Produced our first youth employment program with 15 teenagers.\n‚Ä¢       Represented the City in an international exchange.\n‚Ä¢       Used 30% less salt during winter operation with calibration of trucks, training and increased use of brine.\n \nThese are only few highlights of a long list of accomplishments we have been able to achieve together.  The Department of Public Services is a truly special city department, where the passion to serve ALL our citizens is apparent every single day.  Someone from this department is always ‚Äúon‚Äù - every day of the year, 24 hours per day.\nThe expression of confidence given to me by City Manager Black is only a reflection of the confidence he - and the rest of the City - has about this Department.  Confidence in this Department is the reason why our own Deputy Director will now assume the role of Interim Director.  I have complete and full confidence in Maraskeshia, the rest of our entire Executive Team and all of you to continue to carry out the great new tradition of DPS.  Cincinnati is experiencing a Renaissance.  Our bond rating has increased, we solved our pension crisis, we have now two straight years of structurally balanced budget, our Police Department is the envy of the world, our Department of Public Services is recognized by our Citizens for its dedication to provide them the essential basic services with professionalism, competency and care.  I urge you to keep your eyes on our mission of service and on the very special duties we are privileged to be entrusted with. \n\nMany thanks for instantly welcoming me as your Director and for investing your hard work, creativity and enthusiasm to our common effort.  I am very confident that under Maraskeshia‚Äô s leadership this Department will continue to be the ‚ÄúEvery Day Department‚Äù our citizens support, admire and deserve.\n \n \nThank you,\nG√©rald R.

Hell even one of the worst teams last year, the Raiders, are starting to look like they'll actually have a decent season. Watch out for the Texans this year. Even though they lost Andre Johnson the acquired Cicil Shorts and a couple good rookie receivers and have a healthy Arian Foster. Not to mention last year Alfred Blue made a big splash. Plus with a solid defense led by NFL Defensive Player of the Year and voted #1 player of the year on the NFL Top 100 the monster himself J.J. Watt. Finally I believe the Bengals are the team to beat in the AFC North.
