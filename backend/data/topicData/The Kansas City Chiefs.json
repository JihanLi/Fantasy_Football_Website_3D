He graded out at 88 percent or better in every game in his final two seasons and conceded only one sack during that span. He was a 2014 Preseason All-American and blocked for a dynamic UT Martin offense that averaged 30.2 points per game during his career (2011-14).\n\nThis is Sweeton’s second NFL opportunity this offseason after initially signing with the Kansas City Chiefs as an undrafted free agent on May 11. \n\nThe Skyhawks currently have four former players on active NFL rosters in Sweeton (Broncos), Abou Toure (Indianapolis Colts), Jeremy Butler (Baltimore Ravens) and Montori Hughes (Indianapolis Colts).","created_time":"2015-08-03T20:57:47+0000","link":"https://www.facebook.com/wenkwtpr/photos/a.10150089987742038.272259.181885507037/10152889796247038/?type=1","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/s130x130/11825166_10152889796247038_9120341490487843776_n.jpg?oh=023e79ac03c7bb860e58c8a36737ffbb&oe=5644DE2A","from":{"name":"WENK/WTPR","id":"181885507037"},"id":"181885507037_10152889796247038","likes":{"data":[{"id":"10204557067434690"},{"id":"10205461183787494"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDU0NjExODM3ODc0OTQ=","before":"MTAyMDQ1NTcwNjc0MzQ2OTA="}}}},{"message":"This would be an interesting move by Reid...","created_time":"2015-08-03T20:45:00+0000","link":"http://arrowheadaddict.com/2015/08/03/mitch-morse-kansas-city-chiefs-right-guard/","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAJY3MdNzzZDc6m&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.fansided.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F130%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F08%2Fmitch-morse-ncaa-football-missouri-florida-590x900.jpg&cfs=1&sx=4&sy=0&sw=453&sh=453","from":{"name":"Arrowhead Addict","id":"117514964948309"},"id":"117514964948309_1014286691937794","likes":{"data":[{"id":"10207304549036215"},{"id":"867547746627253"},{"id":"934650846577939"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"OTM0NjUwODQ2NTc3OTM5","before":"MTAyMDczMDQ1NDkwMzYyMTU="}}}},{"created_time":"2015-08-03T20:35:13+0000","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oMO9CfG03A","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDB4m_hN6P_B5SL&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0oMO9CfG03A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&cfs=1","from":{"name":"Attn: Kansas City Chiefs Fans","id":"714172071970035"},"id":"714172071970035_870988796288361","likes":{"data":[{"id":"876441812440123"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODc2NDQxODEyNDQwMTIz","before":"ODc2NDQxODEyNDQwMTIz"}}}},{"message":"Finally, we have former @KCChiefs player @Wshields68 on to tell us about the Will to Succeed Foundation!
