But in the team's first practice Friday, quarterbacks coach John McNulty noticed the problem was gone.\n\nRunning backs coach Sylvester Croom noticed it, too, and sauntered up to McNulty to say, \"I think he took that stuff to heart.\"\n\n\"There were a couple things in his footwork with the run game, and now he's got it aced,\" McNulty said. \"So obviously he worked on that over the five weeks.\"\n\n\"... It's just getting out from under center, and getting to different landmarks quick enough so he wasn't cutting the back off. It just was a little glitch on how he was tacking the snap from under center.\n\n\"We worked on it here, but obviously he had a million things to think about. So we figured, 'All right, we'll get that ironed out eventually.' He came back from the summer and he had it down like he'd been doing it for 20 years.\"\n\nAnd while the offense is being installed again from the start, the coaches hardly have to start at Chapter 1 for Mariota.\n\n\"He's able to get to Chapter 2 and 3 on each play where with a lot of rookies you're just hoping they pick up Chapter 1 and will eventually get to the next couple things,\" McNulty said. \"We didn't have to start over with him, we get to higher-level protection stuff and what-ifs.\"","created_time":"2015-08-03T19:30:01+0000","link":"http://es.pn/1MFhVou","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCBUwTZWsZh3IZ1&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fa.espncdn.com%2Fcombiner%2Fi%3Fimg%3D%252Fphoto%252F2015%252F0802%252Fnfl_a_mariota11_1296x1296.jpg&cfs=1","from":{"name":"Marcus Mariota Fan Page","id":"154650508006531"},"id":"154650508006531_568377066633871","likes":{"data":[{"id":"10207363815077578"},{"id":"1621386688114210"},{"id":"828612867257095"},{"id":"10207736996127887"},{"id":"10206347674429034"},{"id":"942290809150915"},{"id":"1037884742896718"},{"id":"505917189561226"},{"id":"10207304645472821"},{"id":"1165449980148769"},{"id":"1134153543268211"},{"id":"1613405052234721"},{"id":"10205839644123740"},{"id":"10206336283824903"},{"id":"915983375141357"},{"id":"981256151918590"},{"id":"10154211791848492"},{"id":"401590656702683"},{"id":"877303589029437"},{"id":"10206856413076126"},{"id":"941915452510960"},{"id":"1000090610015610"},{"id":"924974090897160"},{"id":"10206007576642044"},{"id":"10204821706768154"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDQ4MjE3MDY3NjgxNTQ=","before":"MTAyMDczNjM4MTUwNzc1Nzg="},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/154650508006531_568377066633871/likes?access_token=464303120407231|F7-lEAC3rNqM1U5C1_ThhRi6Q2E&limit=25&after=MTAyMDQ4MjE3MDY3NjgxNTQ%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"from":{"name":"Leslie Beeson-Wall","id":"10206389302805205"},"message":"I love Marcus but the idea that a guy being paid an NFL salary working on a flaw during down time \"wows\" a coach!?!?!

He died from acute drug intoxication and heart disease. Phentermine, a weight-loss drug, was found in his system. His heart weighed more than twice that of an average human heart. He was 66 years old.\n\nCharles Aaron \"Bubba\" Smith was a professional football player who became an actor after his retirement from the sport. He first came into prominence at Michigan State University, where he twice earned All-American honors as a defensive end on the Spartans football team. He had a major role in a 10–10 draw with Notre Dame in 1966 that was billed as \"The Game of the Century.\" \nHe was one of only three players to have his jersey number retired by the program. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nHe played nine years in the NFL with the Baltimore Colts (1967–1971), Oakland Raiders (1973–1974) and Houston Oilers (1975–1976). The first selection of the 1967 NFL Draft, he was the Colts' starting left defensive end for five seasons who played in Super Bowls III and V, the latter with the winning side. He was named to two Pro Bowls and was a First-Team All-Pro in 1971. Despite being 6 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 265 pounds, his tremendous speed and quickness usually caused him to draw two blockers.\n\nDuring his acting career, he mainly specialized in comedic roles in films, television advertisements and programs. For about a decade following his retirement from football, he appeared in various commercials for Miller Lite. His best-known role was as Moses Hightower in the first six Police Academy movies.","created_time":"2015-08-03T18:37:09+0000","link":"https://www.facebook.com/DailyBlackHistoryFacts/photos/a.143153469189074.1073741825.101575520013536/471805242990560/?type=1","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/11796204_471805242990560_667811566105034694_n.jpg?oh=556e7625e83cd967970aeaab7e266790&oe=5647C571","from":{"name":"Daily Black History Facts","id":"101575520013536"},"id":"101575520013536_471805242990560","likes":{"data":[{"id":"708330475978704"},{"id":"10204588943870743"},{"id":"10200813935067842"},{"id":"10204753013329091"},{"id":"1021802827839175"},{"id":"10205023609489899"},{"id":"1017973318213753"},{"id":"10206567493280243"},{"id":"10200889278911159"},{"id":"1884614238431389"},{"id":"500909636741758"},{"id":"1010795552285920"},{"id":"1117629051598666"},{"id":"868464899905377"},{"id":"812621745511610"},{"id":"10153101685043129"},{"id":"10152959298686759"},{"id":"1038360279508575"},{"id":"10153471645573119"},{"id":"10204758869237872"},{"id":"10153495618767605"},{"id":"10204220338340157"},{"id":"1256278127738884"},{"id":"140056029663353"},{"id":"10207668211491778"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDc2NjgyMTE0OTE3Nzg=","before":"NzA4MzMwNDc1OTc4NzA0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/101575520013536_471805242990560/likes?access_token=464303120407231|F7-lEAC3rNqM1U5C1_ThhRi6Q2E&limit=25&after=MTAyMDc2NjgyMTE0OTE3Nzg%3D"}}},{"message":"We hope Tennessee Titans QB Marcus Mariota enjoys his new 2015 Nissan Armada!","created_time":"2015-08-03T18:34:02+0000","link":"https://www.facebook.com/RamseyNissanNJ/photos/a.341464335289.354089.290524625289/10155847173480290/?type=1","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/s130x130/11836789_10155847173480290_6259430682435278572_n.jpg?oh=bf6546ef9de7729e0db518570ca85b16&oe=565750A0","from":{"name":"Ramsey Nissan","id":"290524625289"},"id":"290524625289_10155847173480290","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1619917018268656"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTYxOTkxNzAxODI2ODY1Ng==","before":"MTYxOTkxNzAxODI2ODY1Ng=="}}}},{"message":"As Marcus Mariota faced pressure from rushers in pads, drops were the issue\nPaul Kuharsky, ESPN Staff Writer\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- For a time during Sunday morning’s first practice in pads for the Tennessee Titans, I thought the pressure and people at his feet were having an effect on Marcus Mariota.\n\nBut the rookie quarterback finished 7-on-7 and 11-on-11 drills completing 12 of 18 passes, and three of the misses were drops -- by tight end Delanie Walker and receivers Dorial Green-Beckham and Justin Hunter.\n\nUpon further evaluation -- after watching Mariota finish strong for the third day in a row and speaking with him, his coach and teammates -- I think he did quite well in the amped-up circumstances.\n\n“One of the questions that a lot of people (on the outside) had about him was his ability to stay in the pocket and throw, and there were a couple of great examples today where there was pressure at his feet and he made some good throws,” Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said. “Unfortunately he had two of them dropped.\n\n“It great to see him stay in there, it’s great that he has that confidence. But really what stands out is that he sees things down the field and he’s able to throw it accurately. That’s a great quality.”\n\nMariota said he isn’t really thinking about whether he should take off or throw in those situations.\n\n“It’s going to depend on how it feels for me,” Mariota said. \"I really play kind of instinctually. For me, I’ve just got to trust those instincts.\"\n\nAs for the drops, Mariota said if they become a consistent thing there will be cause for discussion. But he knows they are going to happen, and he considered them an aberration.\n\nMariota’s three-day totals: 38-for-58 without an interception.\n\n“For all of us, the ball is the most important thing,” he said. “If we can take care of it and secure it, hopefully we can have successful drives and score points.”","created_time":"2015-08-03T18:30:01+0000","link":"http://es.pn/1MFhoCZ","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBG8UECYRpyBVrC&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fa.espncdn.com%2Fcombiner%2Fi%3Fimg%3D%252Fmedia%252Fmotion%252F2015%252F0802%252Fdm_150802_nfl_whisenhunt_mariota_presser%252Fdm_150802_nfl_whisenhunt_mariota_presser.jpg&cfs=1","from":{"name":"Marcus Mariota Fan Page","id":"154650508006531"},"id":"154650508006531_568376756633902","likes":{"data":[{"id":"828612867257095"},{"id":"1163878293628870"},{"id":"942290809150915"},{"id":"10207736996127887"},{"id":"505917189561226"},{"id":"1037367152964919"},{"id":"920666227972848"},{"id":"1640141116269892"},{"id":"401590656702683"},{"id":"864326516950465"},{"id":"10204828842265776"},{"id":"731875593608488"},{"id":"882752761803439"},{"id":"10205994436638074"},{"id":"10153150490133074"},{"id":"967627979968716"},{"id":"1635343916744465"},{"id":"10207771787199695"},{"id":"946085692144567"},{"id":"10153092087710875"},{"id":"10155641744336980"},{"id":"10153052328632467"},{"id":"1679792248910568"},{"id":"809234619197348"},{"id":"883841814986237"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODgzODQxODE0OTg2MjM3","before":"ODI4NjEyODY3MjU3MDk1"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/154650508006531_568376756633902/likes?access_token=464303120407231|F7-lEAC3rNqM1U5C1_ThhRi6Q2E&limit=25&after=ODgzODQxODE0OTg2MjM3"}}},{"message":"Even his Tennessee Titans teammates are in awe...","created_time":"2015-08-03T18:24:27+0000","link":"http://ten.247sports.com/Bolt/What-the-Titans-are-saying-about-Mariotas-first-days-in-camp-38534549","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCNgESAW7tTzuYF&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimagizer.imageshack.us%2F270xf%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fs3media.247sports.com%2FUploads%2FAssets%2F823%2F754%2F3754823.jpg&cfs=1","from":{"name":"Attention Tennessee Titans Fans","id":"1483272125223749"},"id":"1483272125223749_1626827184201575","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1022061937813301"},{"id":"1024954630848185"},{"id":"10203810643021621"},{"id":"501308620026634"},{"id":"1120417204639717"},{"id":"10203257368594160"},{"id":"1160382227310449"},{"id":"1259384057421379"},{"id":"10204648065943284"},{"id":"10153079821961716"},{"id":"10205034134149968"},{"id":"702407539903282"},{"id":"1611950872405457"},{"id":"888981704523345"},{"id":"974526795938935"},{"id":"1184679294882733"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTE4NDY3OTI5NDg4MjczMw==","before":"MTAyMjA2MTkzNzgxMzMwMQ=="}}}},{"created_time":"2015-08-03T18:18:34+0000","link":"http://on.scout.com/32a2a9","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAticXdUKUu-zpR&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimgix.scout.com%2F156%2F1562029.jpg%3Ffit%3Dcrop&cfs=1","from":{"name":"Tennessee Titans on Scout","id":"1421327724800080"},"id":"1421327724800080_1602799956652855","likes":{"data":[{"id":"465093406998693"},{"id":"1117629048265333"},{"id":"10207725519320213"},{"id":"10204494618874501"},{"id":"713918868740566"},{"id":"1639551892982908"},{"id":"737917529647450"},{"id":"904296866291469"},{"id":"927853200604608"},{"id":"1015037661869179"},{"id":"10155856615000484"},{"id":"1462049017453255"},{"id":"326241664234596"},{"id":"881870741906627"},{"id":"386761504862544"},{"id":"10203361106866640"},{"id":"157571557908238"},{"id":"500194480154602"},{"id":"104825849868479"},{"id":"744913705620847"},{"id":"1476275202689462"},{"id":"1006266452739008"},{"id":"1474201316230050"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ3NDIwMTMxNjIzMDA1MA==","before":"NDY1MDkzNDA2OTk4Njkz"}}}},{"message":"You don't want to miss today's show.
