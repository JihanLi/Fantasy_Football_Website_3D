He graded out at 88 percent or better in every game in his final two seasons and conceded only one sack during that span. He was a 2014 Preseason All-American and blocked for a dynamic UT Martin offense that averaged 30.2 points per game during his career (2011-14).\n\nThis is Sweeton‚Äôs second NFL opportunity this offseason after initially signing with the Kansas City Chiefs as an undrafted free agent on May 11. \n\nThe Skyhawks currently have four former players on active NFL rosters in Sweeton (Broncos), Abou Toure (Indianapolis Colts), Jeremy Butler (Baltimore Ravens) and Montori Hughes (Indianapolis Colts).","created_time":"2015-08-03T20:57:47+0000","link":"https://www.facebook.com/wenkwtpr/photos/a.10150089987742038.272259.181885507037/10152889796247038/?type=1","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/s130x130/11825166_10152889796247038_9120341490487843776_n.jpg?oh=023e79ac03c7bb860e58c8a36737ffbb&oe=5644DE2A","from":{"name":"WENK/WTPR","id":"181885507037"},"id":"181885507037_10152889796247038","likes":{"data":[{"id":"10204557067434690"},{"id":"10205461183787494"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDU0NjExODM3ODc0OTQ=","before":"MTAyMDQ1NTcwNjc0MzQ2OTA="}}}},{"message":"So pleased have the Indianapolis Colts Training Camp back in Anderson for the sixth year.

Today, we take a look at Ted Torok (Class of 1961) and Joe Minder (Class of 1962).\n\nTed Torok\n (Class of 1961)\nA talented blocker and tackler on the interior line, he was a key member of the 1960 team which fashioned a perfect 10-0 record, won the OVAC Class AAA championship and was ranked No. 8 in Ohio. \nThe 6-4, 215-pound Torok received several post-season accolades as a senior including second team Class A All-Ohio defensive tackle; first team All-OVAC, All-Eastern Ohio and All-Valley.\nWhile at Ferry High, he was a four-year member of the football and basketball teams; a three-year performer in track and a one-year member of the baseball team.\n He went on to the University of Virginia where the 6-5, 250-pound offensive tackle was a three-year letterman and team captain as a senior, playing under Coach Bill Elias, a native of Martins Ferry.\nAfter receiving a tryout with the NFL‚Äôs Baltimore Colts, he played five years (1965-69) with the Norfolk Neptunes of the Continental Football League.\n\nJoe Minder\n(Class of 1962)\nA four-year football letterman, he was a fixture on the offensive line for three-and-a-half seasons.

He died from acute drug intoxication and heart disease. Phentermine, a weight-loss drug, was found in his system. His heart weighed more than twice that of an average human heart. He was 66 years old.\n\nCharles Aaron \"Bubba\" Smith was a professional football player who became an actor after his retirement from the sport. He first came into prominence at Michigan State University, where he twice earned All-American honors as a defensive end on the Spartans football team. He had a major role in a 10‚Äì10 draw with Notre Dame in 1966 that was billed as \"The Game of the Century.\" \nHe was one of only three players to have his jersey number retired by the program. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nHe played nine years in the NFL with the Baltimore Colts (1967‚Äì1971), Oakland Raiders (1973‚Äì1974) and Houston Oilers (1975‚Äì1976). The first selection of the 1967 NFL Draft, he was the Colts' starting left defensive end for five seasons who played in Super Bowls III and V, the latter with the winning side. He was named to two Pro Bowls and was a First-Team All-Pro in 1971. Despite being 6 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 265 pounds, his tremendous speed and quickness usually caused him to draw two blockers.\n\nDuring his acting career, he mainly specialized in comedic roles in films, television advertisements and programs. For about a decade following his retirement from football, he appeared in various commercials for Miller Lite. His best-known role was as Moses Hightower in the first six Police Academy movies.","created_time":"2015-08-03T18:37:09+0000","link":"https://www.facebook.com/DailyBlackHistoryFacts/photos/a.143153469189074.1073741825.101575520013536/471805242990560/?type=1","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/11796204_471805242990560_667811566105034694_n.jpg?oh=556e7625e83cd967970aeaab7e266790&oe=5647C571","from":{"name":"Daily Black History Facts","id":"101575520013536"},"id":"101575520013536_471805242990560","likes":{"data":[{"id":"708330475978704"},{"id":"10204588943870743"},{"id":"10200813935067842"},{"id":"10204753013329091"},{"id":"1021802827839175"},{"id":"10205023609489899"},{"id":"1017973318213753"},{"id":"10206567493280243"},{"id":"10200889278911159"},{"id":"1884614238431389"},{"id":"500909636741758"},{"id":"1010795552285920"},{"id":"1117629051598666"},{"id":"868464899905377"},{"id":"812621745511610"},{"id":"10153101685043129"},{"id":"10152959298686759"},{"id":"1038360279508575"},{"id":"10153471645573119"},{"id":"10204758869237872"},{"id":"10153495618767605"},{"id":"10204220338340157"},{"id":"1256278127738884"},{"id":"140056029663353"},{"id":"10207668211491778"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDc2NjgyMTE0OTE3Nzg=","before":"NzA4MzMwNDc1OTc4NzA0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/v2.4/101575520013536_471805242990560/likes?access_token=464303120407231|F7-lEAC3rNqM1U5C1_ThhRi6Q2E&limit=25&after=MTAyMDc2NjgyMTE0OTE3Nzg%3D"}}},{"message":"Never doubt Vick Ballard.
