The Buffalo Bills have suspended offensive line coach Aaron Kromer without pay for the first six games of the upcoming season.\n\n\"The suspension will begin on Monday, September 7, 2015 and end with the conclusion of the Buffalo Bills vs. Cincinnati Bengals game on October 18, 2015,\" Bills president Russ Brandon said in a statement Sunday night. \"We worked in conjunction with the NFL on this matter and we are highly supportive of the NFL Personal Conduct Policy that holds all NFL club employees to a higher standard.\"\n\nKromer was with the Bills in training camp practice Monday. He had been on indefinite paid administrative leave as Buffalo began training camp Friday morning.\n\nHe will leave the team again at the start of the regular season and will be eligible to return to work for the Bills' Week 7 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars that will be played in London.\n\n2. After nearly two years away from football, Richie Incognito is expected to start at left guard for the Buffalo Bills this season, coach Rex Ryan said Sunday.\n\n\"One thing for sure is Richie's a starter,\" Ryan said. \"I mean, he looks about as good as any of them. He really does.\"\n\nIncognito was \"20 or 30 yards ahead of everybody else\" in the Bills' conditioning test last Thursday, Ryan said, and is in better shape than even the head coach expected.\n\n\"I've been blown away by it,\" Ryan said.\n\nand finally  The Buffalo Bills' shaky quarterback play in practices this spring and summer reached a new low Saturday when Matt Cassel and EJ Manuel went a combined 1-for-8 in a period of 11-on-11 work in practice.\n\nCassel and Manuel split reps with the first-team group in the Bills' \"two-spot\" drill Saturday after Cassel and Tyrod Taylor split time with that group Friday. If the pattern holds, Taylor and Manuel will be the first-team pairing Sunday.\n\nHere is the sequence of plays during the first 11-on-11 set of Saturday's practice:\n\nCassel:\n\nFirst down: Wobbled throw to Sammy Watkins down left sideline; Watkins came back to ball but pass was broken up by cornerback Ronald Darby in the end zone.\n\nSecond down: Run by LeSean McCoy.\n\nFirst down: Overthrown to Percy Harvin on out-breaking route.\n\nSecond down: Completed dump-off to tight end Matthew Mulligan.\n\nFirst down: Run by McCoy.\n\nManuel:\n\nSecond down: Overthrown to Harvin down right sideline.\n\nFirst down: Rollout and short pass to Harvin; pass broken up by cornerback Nickell Robey.\n\nSecond down: Pass thrown behind Sammy Watkins on drag route.\n\nFirst down: Overthrown to Chris Hogan deep down the middle.\n\nSecond down: Underthrown to Marquise Goodwin down left sideline; near interception by the cornerback in coverage.\n\nThe results improved slightly in the second 11-on-11 period, which featured more shorter passes, including some screen passes. Taylor went 3-for-4 in that period, although he avoided a would-be sack by Kyle Williams for one completion. Cassel also completed 3 of 4 passes in that set, including an impressive catch by Robert Woods over cornerback Ross Cockrell.\n\nAs expected, Taylor has shown a greater willingness to scramble out of the pocket -- and also to tuck the ball and run -- than the other two quarterbacks. With no contact allowed by defenders against the quarterback, it has been difficult to gauge whether he would be able to get off throws in live action that he can attempt in practice.\n\nCassel and Manuel have been plagued by inaccuracy, even on unguarded routes and 1-on-1 drills between receivers and cornerbacks. While they've been assisted by the athleticism and ball skills of Sammy Watkins and Woods, the quarterbacks have also been hurt by several drops by Hogan, Goodwin and Marcus Easley over the first two days of training camp.\n\nThere is no indication that the Bills are close to narrowing the group competing for the starting job to two quarterbacks, nor has there been any clear separation by any of the three quarterbacks over one another to this point.
