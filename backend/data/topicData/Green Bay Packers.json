After moving to Green Bay, I started playing with the Green Bay Rugby Club. I can't play in many matches (a Saturday work schedule doesn't match up well with their Saturday games), but I do practice and play in tournaments when I can to stay active with the club. GBRFC is coming off one of its most successful years in recent history and moving up a division to D-II from D-III. As part of that move, they're starting a brand-new D-4 developmental side to give new players a chance to learn the game the best way possible-- by actually playing in competitive matches.\n\nBut to do this, we need more numbers! If you're an athlete interested in something new or if you're just looking to try something different to stay active, come check out a practice. All you need is yourself, a mouth guard, and a pair of cleats.
